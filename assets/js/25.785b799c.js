There is a class called StateMachine, which consists of shared pointers to the objects of the classes Data, Status and State1 to State4. The shared pointers of types Status and Data are passed by parameters of the constructor of the StateMachine class. The objects of State1 to State4 types are allocated on heap in this constructor. Objects of types Data, Status and StateMachine are allocated on heap in the main function. Transitions of the state machine, made possible by derivation from the base class State, are implemented in the function runSTM(). They are dependent on the results of the business logic of each state, but there is only one main loop, which runs until exit is initiated. In common, the states can be filled with custom business logic, but in this example a random number is generated, which represents the next state and main loop executes the next state in the next iteration. The execution stops ordinary in the 4-th state and with an error during transition from the 3-rd to the 4-th state. It is implemented this way only in order to show the principle. Generally, as mentioned above, this design can be configured to work in any way, depending on needs.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("The principal programe flow is described by the following sequence diagram.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[t("img",{attrs:{src:a(340),alt:"UMLDiagram"}})])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
