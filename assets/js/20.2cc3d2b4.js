Objects of types Data, Status and StateMachine are allocated on heap in the main function. Transitions of the state machine, made possible by derivation from the base class State, are implemented in the function runSTM(). They are dependent on the results of the business logic of each state, but there is only one main loop, which runs until exit is initiated. In common, the states can be filled with custom business logic, but in this example a random number is generated, which represents the next state and main loop executes the next state in the next iteration. The execution stops ordinary in the 4-th state and with an error during transition from the 3-rd to the 4-th state. It is implemented this way only in order to show the principle.

For example, you have many images and it is necessary to process them and get some information out of them. You have also a library that consists of different computer vision algorithms, but you still don't know which is the most optimal way to apply those algorithms. Developing the procedure is time consuming due to checking many combinations and tuning parameters of algorithms. It is also very helpfull to be able to control the results after each step. My solution would be to program a tool with user interface, that lists in one window all possible steps, which can be chosen and added to the next window describing the resulting procedure. This is exactly the case, where a task queue design pattern can be applied. The steps from the resulting procedure are put into a task queue and then processed one after another.
