In common, the states can be filled with custom business logic, but in this example a random number is generated, which represents the next state and main loop executes the next state in the next iteration. The execution stops ordinary in the 4-th state and with an error during transition from the 3-rd to the 4-th state. It is implemented this way only in order to show the principle.

You have also a library that consists of different computer vision algorithms, but you still don't know which is the most optimal way to apply those algorithms. Developing the procedure is time consuming due to checking many combinations and tuning parameters of algorithms. It is also very helpfull to be able to control the results after each step. My solution would be to program a tool with user interface, that lists in one window all possible steps, which can be chosen and added to the next window describing the resulting procedure.
