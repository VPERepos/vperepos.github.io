Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required.<br></li> <li><strong>List</strong> - a linked list is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.<br></li> <li><strong>Record</strong> - a record (also <strong>called tuple</strong> or <strong>struct</strong>) is an <strong>aggregate data structure</strong>. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects. <br></li> <li><strong>Hash tables</strong> -  also known as hash maps, are data structures that provide fast retrieval of values based on keys. They use a hashing function to map keys to indexes in an array, allowing for constant-time access in the average case. Hash tables are commonly used in dictionaries, caches, and database indexing. However, hash collisions can occur, which can impact their performance. Techniques like chaining and open addressing are employed to handle collisions.<br></li> <li><strong>Graphs</strong> - collections of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between entities. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have cycles or be acyclic.<br></li> <li><strong>Stacks and queues</strong> - abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. A stack has two primary operations: push (adds an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removes the topmost element from the stack), that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Queues have two main operations: enqueue (adds an element to the rear of the queue) and dequeue (removes an element from the front of the queue) that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.<br></li> <li><strong>Trees</strong> - represent a hierarchical organization of elements. A tree consists of nodes connected by edges, with one node being the root and all other nodes forming subtrees. <strong>Binary trees</strong> (particularly heaps), <strong>AVL trees</strong>, and <strong>B-trees</strong> are some popular types of trees. They enable efficient and optimal searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation of data.</li> <li><strong>Trie</strong> - also known as a <strong>prefix tree</strong>, is a specialized tree data structure used for the efficient retrieval of strings. Tries store characters of a string as nodes, with each edge representing a character. They are particularly useful in text processing scenarios like autocomplete, spell-checking, and dictionary implementations. Tries enable fast searching and prefix-based operations on strings.<br></li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-linear-data-structure-name-a-few-examples"><a href="#what-is-a-linear-data-structure-name-a-few-examples" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Linear Data Structure? Name a few examples.</h4> <p>A data structure is linear if all its elements or data items are arranged in a sequence or a linear order. The elements are stored in a <strong>non-hierarchical way</strong> so that each item has successors and predecessors except the first and last element in the list.
Examples of linear data structures are <strong>Array</strong>, <strong>Stack</strong>, <strong>Queue</strong>, and <strong>Linked List</strong>.<br></p> <h4 id="how-are-the-elements-of-a-2d-array-stored-in-the-memory"><a href="#how-are-the-elements-of-a-2d-array-stored-in-the-memory" class="header-anchor">#</a> How are the elements of a 2D Array stored in the memory.</h4> <ul><li><strong>Row-Major Order</strong>: In row-major ordering, the first row of a 2D array is entirely stored in memory, followed by the second row of the array, and so on until the final row.</li> <li><strong>Column-Major Order</strong>: In column-major ordering, the first column of the array is entirely saved in memory, followed by the second row of the array, and so on until the last column of the array is fully recorded in the memory.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-some-use-cases-for-row-major-and-column-major-storing-of-2d-arrays"><a href="#what-are-some-use-cases-for-row-major-and-column-major-storing-of-2d-arrays" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are some use cases for Row-Major and Column-Major storing of 2D Arrays?</h4> <p><strong>Row-Major</strong> stored arrays are more efficient for row-wise access like in <strong>Image Processing</strong>. <strong>Column-Major</strong> stored arrays are more efficient for column-wise access like for <strong>Matrix Multiplication</strong>.<br></p> <h4 id="how-can-you-possibly-choose-between-row-major-and-column-major-2d-arrays-storing-implementations"><a href="#how-can-you-possibly-choose-between-row-major-and-column-major-2d-arrays-storing-implementations" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can you possibly choose between Row-Major and Column-Major 2D Arrays storing implementations?</h4> <p>By choosing a <strong>programming language</strong>. <strong>Row-Major</strong> is implemented in languages like C/C++ and <strong>Column-Major</strong> - in Fortran.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-linked-list-data-structure"><a href="#what-is-a-linked-list-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Linked List Data Structure?</h4> <p>It’s a both <strong>linear and non-linear Data Structure</strong>, depending on application, or a sequence of data objects where <strong>elements are not stored in adjacent memory locations</strong>. The elements are linked using pointers to form a chain. Each element is a separate object, called a node.  Each node has two items: a data field and a reference to the next node. The entry point in a linked list is called the head. Where the list is empty, the head is a null reference and the last node has a reference to null. A linked list is a dynamic data structure, where the number of nodes is not fixed, and the list has the ability to grow and shrink on demand.
It is applied in cases where:</p> <ul><li>We deal with an unknown number of objects or don’t know how many items are in the list</li> <li>We need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list, as in real-time computing where time predictability is critical</li> <li>Random access to any elements is not needed</li> <li>The algorithm requires a data structure where objects need to be stored irrespective of their physical address in memory</li> <li>We need to insert items in the middle of the list as in a priority queue
<br></li></ul> <h4 id="are-linked-lists-considered-linear-or-non-linear-data-structures"><a href="#are-linked-lists-considered-linear-or-non-linear-data-structures" class="header-anchor">#</a> Are Linked Lists considered Linear or Non-linear Data Structures?</h4> <p>Linked lists are considered both linear and non-linear data structures depending upon the application they are used for. When used for access strategies, it is considered as a linear data-structure. When used for data storage, it is considered a non-linear data structure.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-a-linked-list-over-an-array-in-which-scenarios-do-we-use-linked-list-and-when-array"><a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-a-linked-list-over-an-array-in-which-scenarios-do-we-use-linked-list-and-when-array" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the advantages of a Linked List over an Array? In which scenarios do we use Linked List and when Array?</h4> <p>Advantages of a linked list over an array are:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Insertion and Deletion</strong><br>
Insertion and deletion of nodes is an easier process, as we only update the address present in the next pointer of a node. It’s expensive to do the same in an array as the room has to be created for the new elements and existing elements must be shifted.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Dynamic Data Structure</strong><br>
As a linked list is a dynamic data structure, there is no need to give an initial size as it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory. However, the size is limited in an array as the number of elements is statically stored in the main memory.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>No wastage of Memory</strong><br>
As the size of a linked list can increase or decrease depending on the demands of the program, and memory is allocated only when required, there is no memory wasted. In the case of an array, there is memory wastage. For instance, if we declare an array of size 10 and store only five elements in it, then the space for five elements is wasted.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Implementation</strong><br>
Data structures like stack and queues are more easily implemented using a linked list than an array.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Some scenarios where we use linked list over array are</strong>:</p> <ul><li>When we do not know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance</li> <li>When there are a large number of add or remove operations</li> <li>When there are no large number of random access to elements</li> <li>When we want to insert items in the middle of the list, such as when implementing a priority queue<br></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Some scenarios in which we use array over the linked list are</strong>:</p> <ul><li>When we need to index or randomly access elements</li> <li>When we know the number of elements in the array beforehand, so we can allocate the correct amount of memory</li> <li>When we need speed when iterating through all the elements in the sequence</li> <li>When memory is a concern; filled arrays use less memory than linked lists, as each element in the array is the data but each linked list node requires the data as well as one or more pointers to the other elements in the linked list
<br></li></ul></li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-doubly-linked-list"><a href="#what-is-a-doubly-linked-list" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Doubly-Linked List?</h4> <p>It is a complex type (double-ended LL) of a linked list in which a node has two links, one that connects to the next node in the sequence and another that connects to the previous node. This allows traversal across the data elements in both directions.<br></p> <h4 id="what-are-dynamic-data-structures-name-a-few"><a href="#what-are-dynamic-data-structures-name-a-few" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are Dynamic Data Structures? Name a few.</h4> <p>They are collections of data in memory that expand and contract to grow or shrink in size as a program runs. This enables the programmer to control exactly how much memory is to be utilized. Examples are the <strong>dynamic array</strong>, <strong>linked list</strong>, <strong>stack</strong>, <strong>queue</strong>, and <strong>heap</strong>.<br></p> <h4 id="what-is-a-stack"><a href="#what-is-a-stack" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Stack?</h4> <p>A stack is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure, as in a real physical stack or piles where you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things. Thus, insertion (push) and deletion (pop) of items take place only at one end called top of the stack, with a particular order: LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).</p> <h4 id="where-are-stacks-used"><a href="#where-are-stacks-used" class="header-anchor">#</a> Where are Stacks used?</h4> <ul><li>Expression, evaluation, or conversion of evaluating prefix, postfix, and infix expressions</li> <li>Syntax parsing</li> <li>String reversal</li> <li>Parenthesis checking</li> <li>Backtracking</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-the-operations-that-can-be-performed-on-a-stack"><a href="#what-are-the-operations-that-can-be-performed-on-a-stack" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the operations that can be performed on a Stack?</h4> <p>A stack may perform three fundamental operations:</p> <ul><li>PUSH: The push action inserts a new element into the stack. The new feature is placed at the top of the stack.</li> <li>POP: The pop operation is performed to remove the stack's topmost element.</li> <li>PEEK: A peek action returns the value of the stack's topmost element without removing it from the stack.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-queue-data-structure"><a href="#what-is-a-queue-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a queue Data Structure?</h4> <p>A queue is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure or an ordered list,  using the First In First Out (FIFO) operation to access elements. Insert operations can be performed only at one end called REAR and delete operations can be performed only at the other end called FRONT.</p> <h4 id="list-some-applications-of-the-queue-data-structure"><a href="#list-some-applications-of-the-queue-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> List some applications of the Queue Data Structure.</h4> <p>To prioritize jobs as in the following scenarios:</p> <ul><li>As waiting lists for a single shared resource (like printer, CPU, call center systems).</li> <li>In the asynchronous transfer of data (file IO, sockets).</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-dequeue"><a href="#what-is-a-dequeue" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Dequeue?</h4> <p>It is a double-ended queue, or a data structure, where the elements can be inserted or deleted at both ends (FRONT and REAR).</p> <h4 id="what-operations-can-be-performed-on-queues"><a href="#what-operations-can-be-performed-on-queues" class="header-anchor">#</a> What operations can be performed on Queues?</h4> <ul><li>enqueue() adds an element to the end of the queue</li> <li>dequeue() removes an element from the front of the queue</li> <li>init() is used for initializing the queue</li> <li>isEmpty() tests for whether or not the queue is empty</li> <li>The front is used to get the value of the first data item but does not remove it</li> <li>The rear is used to get the last item from a queue</li></ul> <h4 id="define-the-graph-data-structure"><a href="#define-the-graph-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define the Graph Data Structure.</h4> <p>It is a type of non-linear data structure that consists of vertices or nodes connected by edges or arcs to enable storage or retrieval of data.

A tree is referred to as a generic tree if its hierarchy is not constrained. In the General Tree, each node can have an endless number of offspring, and all other trees are subsets of the tree.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>The Binary Tree</strong> <br>
The binary tree is a type of tree in which each parent has at least two offspring. The children are referred to as the left and right youngsters. This tree is more popular than most others. When specific limitations and features are given to a Binary tree, various trees such as AVL tree, BST (Binary Search Tree), RBT tree, and so on are also utilized. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Binary Search Tree</strong> <br>
Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree extension that includes numerous optional constraints. In BST, a node's left child value should be less than or equal to the parent value, while the right child value should always be higher than the parent's value.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>The AVL Tree</strong> <br>
The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions). The term AVL is given in honor of the inventors Adelson-Velshi and Landis. This was the first tree to achieve dynamic equilibrium. Each node in the AVL tree is assigned a balancing factor based on whether the tree is balanced or not. The node kids have a maximum height of one AVL vine. Search, insert, delete operations have O(log n) complexity.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Red and Black Tree</strong> <br>
Red-black trees are another type of auto-balancing tree. The red-black term is derived from the qualities of the red-black tree, which has either red or black painted on each node. It helps to keep the forest in balance. Even though this tree is not perfectly balanced, the searching process takes just O(log n) time. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>The N-ary Tree</strong> <br>
In this sort of tree with a node, N is the maximum number of children. A binary tree is a two-year tree since each binary tree node has no more than two offsprings. A full N-ary tree is one in which the children of each node are either 0 or N. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Octree</strong> <br>

During rotations the fundamental property of binary trees must be satisfied that the right child node is bigger than the parent and the left one is smaller. After rotations balance factors are calculated again and if they are -1,0 or 1 a new element can be inserted. Otherwise rotations are conducted further until balanced state is achieved.</p> <h4 id="explain-the-mechanism-of-self-balancing-in-red-black-trees"><a href="#explain-the-mechanism-of-self-balancing-in-red-black-trees" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain the mechanism of Self-Balancing in Red-Black Trees.</h4> <p>The fundamental rules of Red-Black Trees are:<br>
1. Every node has a color either red or black.<br>
2. The root of the tree is always black.<br>
3. There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).<br>
4. Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendants NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.<br>
5. Every leaf (e.i. NULL node) must be colored BLACK.<br>
After insertion two basic operations are used in order to ensure the balance: <strong>Rotation and Recolouring</strong>. First, an element is inserted like in general binary trees and coloured red. One tries first the recolouring during balancing and if it does not work, rotations are conducted. If the new node (<strong>child</strong>) appears to be the root it is recoloured in black (see properties). Check the colour of the parent (<strong>father</strong>) node. If it is black then left the colour of the child node as red. If the father is also red, check the colour of its opposite node (<strong>uncle</strong>) on the same level. If the color of this node is also red then change both father and uncle nodes to black and the <strong>grandfather</strong> (parent node of father and uncle) to red if its not the root node, otherwise do not change the grandfathers color. Repeat the procedure for grandfather upwards. But if the uncle's color is black then rotations in 4 possible ways are conducted untill one can recolour the new arrangement of the nodes.</p> <h4 id="what-is-recursion"><a href="#what-is-recursion" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Recursion?</h4> <p>Recursion is defined as a process which calls itself directly or indirectly and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

Problems like Transportation, manufacturing and diet can be solved by this approach. <br>
A linear programming problem consits of <strong>Decision Variables</strong>, <strong>Objective Function</strong>, <strong>Constraints</strong> and <strong>Non-negative Restrictions</strong>.
Decision variables are the variables x, and y, which decide the output of the linear programming problem and represent the final solution.
The objective function, generally represented by Z, is the linear function that needs to be optimized according to the given condition to get the final solution. The restrictions imposed on decision variables that limit their values are called constraints.
Now, the general formula of a linear programming problem is:<br>
Objective Function: Z = ax + by <br>
Constraints: cx + dy ≥ e, px + qy ≤ r <br>
Non-Negative restrictions: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 <br>

By representing each constraint equation in a row and writing the objective function at the bottom row. The table so obtained is called the Simplex table.</p> <p>Step 4: Identify the greatest negative entry in the bottom row the column of the element with the highest negative entry is called the pivot column</p> <p>Step 5: Divide the entries of the right-most column with the entries of the respective pivot column, excluding the entries of the bottommost row. Now the row containing the least entry is called the pivot row. The pivot element is obtained by the intersection of the pivot row and the pivot column.</p> <p>Step 6: Using matrix operation and with the help of the pivot element make all the entries in the pivot column to be zero.</p> <p>Step 7: Check for the non-negative entries in the bottommost row if there are no negative entries in the bottom row, end the process else start the process again from step 4.</p> <p>Step 8: The final simplex table so obtained gives the solution to our problem.</p> <p>Steps for the <strong>Graphical Method</strong> are:</p> <p>Step 1: First convert the inequations into normal equations.</p> <p>Step 2: Find the points at which equations cut the x-axis and y-axis.

It is a collection of application programs which allow the user to organize, restore and retrieve information about data as effectively as possible. Some of the popular DBMS’s are MySql, Oracle, PostgreSql, SqLite, etc.</p> <h4 id="define-rdbms"><a href="#define-rdbms" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define RDBMS.</h4> <p>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is based on a relational model of data that is stored in databases in separate tables and they are related to the use of a common column. Data can be accessed easily from the relational database using Structured Query Language (SQL).</p> <h4 id="enlist-the-advantages-of-dbms"><a href="#enlist-the-advantages-of-dbms" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist the advantages of DBMS.</h4> <p>The advantages of DBMS includes:</p> <ul><li>Data is stored in a structured way and hence redundancy is controlled.</li> <li>Validates the data entered and provide restrictions on unauthorized access to the database.</li> <li>Provides backup and recovery of the data when required.</li> <li>It provides multiple user interfaces.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-the-database-transaction"><a href="#what-is-the-database-transaction" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the Database Transaction?</h4> <p>Sequence of operation performed which changes the consistent state of the database to another is known as the database transaction. After the completion of the transaction, either the successful completion is reflected in the system or the transaction fails and no change is reflected.</p> <h4 id="enlist-four-fundamental-properties-of-transactions-in-rdbms"><a href="#enlist-four-fundamental-properties-of-transactions-in-rdbms" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist four fundamental Properties of Transactions in RDBMS.</h4> <p>Four crucial properties define relational database transactions: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability—typically referred to as ACID.</p> <ul><li><strong>Atomicity</strong> defines all the elements that make up a complete database transaction.</li> <li><strong>Consistency</strong> defines the rules for maintaining data points in a correct state after a transaction.</li> <li><strong>Isolation</strong> keeps the effect of a transaction invisible to others until it is committed, to avoid confusion.</li> <li><strong>Durability</strong> ensures that data changes become permanent once the transaction is committed.</li></ul> <h4 id="explain-the-terms-‘record’-‘field’-and-‘table’-in-terms-of-database"><a href="#explain-the-terms-‘record’-‘field’-and-‘table’-in-terms-of-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain the terms ‘Record’, ‘Field’ and ‘Table’ in terms of database.</h4> <p><strong>Record:</strong> Record is a collection of values or fields of a specific entity. For Example, An employee, Salary account, etc. <br> <strong>Field:</strong> A field refers to an area within a record that is reserved for specific data. For Example, Employee ID.<br> <strong>Table:</strong> Table is the collection of records of specific types. For Example, the Employee table is a collection of records related to all the employees.<br></p> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-data-redundancy"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-data-redundancy" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by Data Redundancy?</h4> <p>Duplication of data in the database is known as data redundancy. As a result of data redundancy, duplicated data is present at multiple locations, hence it leads to wastage of the storage space and the integrity of the database is destroyed.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-primary-key-in-a-relational-database"><a href="#what-is-a-primary-key-in-a-relational-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Primary Key in a Relational Database?</h4> <p>A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values uniquely identify a row in the table. A relational database is designed to enforce the uniqueness of primary keys by allowing only one row with a given primary key value in a table.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-foreign-key-in-a-relational-database"><a href="#what-is-a-foreign-key-in-a-relational-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Foreign Key in a Relational Database?</h4> <p>A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values correspond to the values of the primary key in another table. In order to add a row with a given foreign key value, there must exist a row in the related table with the same primary key value.</p> <h4 id="what-are-non-key-attributes"><a href="#what-are-non-key-attributes" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are Non-key Attributes?</h4> <p>Non-key attributes are attributes that are not part of any key. Generally, most attributes are simply descriptive, and fall into this category. Consider an Employee entity type that has attributes for first name, last name, birth date; these attributes would serve to describe an employee but would not serve to uniquely identify employees.</p> <h4 id="categorize-data-modification-anomalies-in-a-database"><a href="#categorize-data-modification-anomalies-in-a-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> Categorize Data Modification Anomalies in a Database.</h4> <ul><li><strong>Insertion Anomaly</strong>: Insertion Anomaly refers to when one cannot insert a new tuple into a relationship due to lack of data.</li> <li><strong>Deletion Anomaly</strong>: The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.</li> <li><strong>Updatation Anomaly</strong>: The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-the-various-types-of-relationships-in-database-define-them"><a href="#what-are-the-various-types-of-relationships-in-database-define-them" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the various types of relationships in Database? Define them.</h4> <p>There are 3 types of relationships in Database:</p> <ul><li><strong>One-to-one</strong>: One table has a relationship with another table having the similar kind of column. Each primary key relates to only one or no  record in the related table.</li> <li><strong>One-to-many</strong>: One table has a relationship with another table that has primary and foreign key relations. The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one or many records in the related table.</li> <li><strong>Many-to-many</strong>: Each record in both the tables can relate to many numbers of records in another table.</li></ul> <h4 id="explain-normalization-and-de-normalization"><a href="#explain-normalization-and-de-normalization" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain Normalization and De-Normalization.</h4> <p><strong>Normalization</strong> is the process of removing redundant data from the database by splitting the table in a well-defined manner in order to maintain data integrity. This process saves much of the storage space. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.</p> <p><strong>De-normalization</strong> is the process of adding up redundant data on the table in order to speed up the complex queries and thus achieve better performance.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-different-types-of-normalization"><a href="#what-are-the-different-types-of-normalization" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the different types of Normalization?</h4> <p>Different types of Normalization are:</p> <ul><li><strong>First Normal Form (1NF)</strong>: A relation is said to be in 1NF only when all the entities of the table contain unique or atomic values. It meens all rows must be unique, each cell must contain only single value (not a list) and each value should be non-divisible (can't be split down further).</li> <li><strong>Second Normal Form (2NF)</strong>: A relation is said to be in 2NF only if it is in 1NF and all the non-key attribute of the table is fully dependent on the primary key. For example we have a table with columns composed of Student ID, Course ID and Course Fee. Course Fee does not depend fully on the primary key represented by Student ID. In order to achieve 2NF on splits the table in one that contains Student ID and Course ID and another that contains Course ID and Course Fee.</li> <li><strong>Third Normal Form (3NF)</strong>: A relation is said to be in 3NF only if it is in 2NF and every non-key attribute of the table is not transitively dependent on the primary key. For example if we have a table containing Tournament Name, Year, Winner's Name and Winner's Date of Birth. Winners date of birth can be defined by winner's name and not by the primary key represented by tournament name and year, so the table must be split.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-bcnf"><a href="#what-is-bcnf" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is BCNF?</h4> <p>BCNF is the Boyce Code Normal form. It is the higher version of 3Nf which does not have any multiple overlapping candidate keys. For example if we have a table with Student ID, Corse ID and Professor ID, where the same course could be held by different professors, we have to split the table into table eith Student ID and professor ID and the table with professor ID and Course ID.</p> <h4 id="what-is-sql"><a href="#what-is-sql" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is SQL?</h4> <p>Structured Query language, SQL is an ANSI (American National Standard Institute) standard programming language that is designed specifically for storing and managing the data in the relational database management system (RDBMS) using all kinds of data operations.</p> <h4 id="how-many-sql-statements-are-used-define-them"><a href="#how-many-sql-statements-are-used-define-them" class="header-anchor">#</a> How many SQL statements are used? Define them.</h4> <p>SQL statements are basically divided into three categories, DDL, DML, and DCL. <br>
They can be defined as:</p> <ul><li><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong> commands are used to define the structure that holds the data. These commands are auto-committed i.e. changes done by the DDL commands on the database are saved permanently.</li> <li><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong> commands are used to manipulate the data of the database. These commands are not auto-committed and can be rolled back.</li> <li><strong>Data Control Language (DCL)</strong> commands are used to control the visibility of the data in the database like revoke access permission for using data in the database.</li></ul> <h4 id="enlist-some-commands-of-ddl-dml-and-dcl"><a href="#enlist-some-commands-of-ddl-dml-and-dcl" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist some commands of DDL, DML and DCL.</h4> <ul><li><p><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL) commands:</strong> <br>
CREATE to create a new table or database.<br>
ALTER for alteration.<br>
TRUNCATE to delete data from the table.<br>
DROP to drop a table.<br>
RENAME to rename a table.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands:</strong><br>
INSERT to insert a new row.<br>
UPDATE to update an existing row.<br>
DELETE to delete a row.<br>
MERGE for merging two rows or two tables.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Data Control Language (DCL) commands:</strong><br>
COMMIT to permanently save.<br>
ROLLBACK to undo the change.<br>
SAVEPOINT to save temporarily.<br></p></li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-quaery-processor-in-dbms"><a href="#what-is-quaery-processor-in-dbms" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Quaery Processor in DBMS?</h4> <p>The Query Processor receives the queries (requests) from the user and interprets them in the form of instructions. It has four components: <strong>DML Compiler</strong>, <strong>DDL Interpreter</strong>, <strong>Query Optimizer</strong> and <strong>Embedded DML Pre-compiler</strong>.</p> <h4 id="define-dml-compiler"><a href="#define-dml-compiler" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define DML Compiler.</h4> <p>It converts the DML (Data Manipulation Language) Instructions into Machine Language (low-level language).</p> <h4 id="what-is-ddl-interpreter"><a href="#what-is-ddl-interpreter" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is DDL interpreter?</h4> <p>It interprets the DDL (Data Definition Language) Instructions and stores the record in a data dictionary (in a table containing meta-data).</p> <h4 id="what-is-query-optimizer"><a href="#what-is-query-optimizer" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Query Optimizer?</h4> <p>It executes the DML Instructions and picks the lowest cost evaluation plan out of all the alternatives present.</p> <h4 id="what-is-embedded-dml-pre-compiler"><a href="#what-is-embedded-dml-pre-compiler" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Embedded DML Pre-compiler?</h4> <p>It translates the DML statements embedded in Application Programs into procedural function calls.</p> <h4 id="enlist-the-advantages-of-sql"><a href="#enlist-the-advantages-of-sql" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist the advantages of SQL.</h4> <ul><li>Simple SQL queries can be used to retrieve a large amount of data from the database very quickly and efficiently.</li> <li>SQL is easy to learn and almost every DBMS supports SQL.</li> <li>It is easier to manage the database using SQL as no large amount of coding is required.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-relational-database-schema"><a href="#what-is-a-relational-database-schema" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Relational Database Schema?</h4> <p>A database schema refers to the logical and visual configuration of the entire relational database. The database objects are often grouped and displayed as tables, functions, and relations. A schema describes the organization and storage of data in a database and defines the relationship between various tables.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-physical-level-in-a-relational-database"><a href="#what-is-a-physical-level-in-a-relational-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Physical Level in a Relational Database.</h4> <p>The concept of Physical Level in a database refers to the lowest level of organization and representation of data in a database management system. At the physical level, data is represented in the form of bits, bytes, and blocks of data stored on a storage device (such as a hard drive or solid-state drive).</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-conceptual-logical-level-in-a-relational-database"><a href="#what-is-a-conceptual-logical-level-in-a-relational-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Conceptual (Logical) Level in a Relational Database.</h4> <p>The conceptual level is a way of describing what data is stored within the whole database and how the data is inter-related. The conceptual level does not specify how the data is physically stored.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-view-level-in-a-relational-database"><a href="#what-is-a-view-level-in-a-relational-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a View Level in a Relational Database?</h4> <p>Views are virtual tables. They are only a structure, and contain no data. Their purpose is to allow a user to see a subset of the actual data. A view can consist of a subset of one table. A View can be considered as a template query.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-views-in-the-database"><a href="#what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-views-in-the-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the advantages and disadvantages of views in the database?</h4> <p><strong>Advantages of Views:</strong></p> <ul><li>As there is no physical location where the data in the view is stored, it generates output without wasting resources.</li> <li>Data access is restricted as it does not allow commands like insertion, updation, and deletion.<br></li></ul> <p><strong>Disadvantages of Views:</strong></p> <ul><li>The view becomes irrelevant if we drop a table related to that view.</li> <li>Much memory space is occupied when the view is created for large tables.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-data-independence-what-are-its-two-types"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-data-independence-what-are-its-two-types" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by Data Independence? What are its two types?</h4> <p>Data Independence refers to the ability to modify the schema definition in one level in such a way that it does not affect the schema definition in the next higher level.<br>
The 2 types of Data Independence are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Physical Data Independence:</strong> It modifies the schema at the physical level without affecting the schema at the conceptual level.</li> <li><strong>Logical Data Independence:</strong> It modifies the schema at the conceptual level without affecting or causing changes in the schema at the view level.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-functional-dependency"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-functional-dependency" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by Functional dependency?</h4> <p>A relation is said to be in functional dependency when one attribute uniquely defines another attribute. For Example, R is a Relation, X and Y are two attributes. T1 and T2 are two tuples. Then,<br>
T1[X]=T2[X] and T1[Y]=T2[Y] <br>
Means, the value of component X uniquely define the value of component Y. Also, X-&gt;Y means Y is functionally dependent on X.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-fully-functional-dependancy"><a href="#what-is-a-fully-functional-dependancy" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Fully Functional Dependancy?</h4> <p>To fulfill the criteria of fully functional dependency, the relation must meet the requirement of functional dependency. A functional dependency ‘A’ and ‘B’ are said to be fully functional dependent when removal of any attribute say ‘X’ from ‘A’ means the dependency does not hold anymore.</p> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-the-e-r-model"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-the-e-r-model" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by the E-R model?</h4> <p>E-R model is an Entity-Relationship model which defines the Conceptual View of the database. The E-R model basically shows the real-world entities and their association/relations. Entities here represent the set of attributes in the database.</p> <h4 id="define-entity-entity-type-and-entity-set"><a href="#define-entity-entity-type-and-entity-set" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define Entity, Entity type, and Entity set.</h4> <p><strong>Entity</strong> can be anything, be it a place, class or object which has an independent existence in the real world. <br> <strong>Entity Type</strong> represents a set of entities that have similar attributes.<br> <strong>Entity Set</strong> in the database represents a collection of entities having a particular entity type.<br></p> <h4 id="what-is-a-weak-entity"><a href="#what-is-a-weak-entity" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Weak Entity?</h4> <p>In a relational database, a weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone; therefore, it must use a foreign key in conjunction with its attributes to create a primary key. The foreign key is typically a primary key of an entity it is related to.</p> <h4 id="explain-the-terms-‘attribute’-and-‘relations’"><a href="#explain-the-terms-‘attribute’-and-‘relations’" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain the terms ‘Attribute’ and ‘Relations’.</h4> <p><strong>Attribute</strong> is described as the properties or characteristics of an entity. For Example, Employee ID, Employee Name, Age, etc., can be attributes of the entity Employee. <br> <strong>Relation</strong> is a two-dimensional table containing a number of rows and columns where every row represents a record of the relation. Here, rows are also known as ‘Tuples’ and columns are known as ‘Attributes’. <br></p> <h4 id="what-are-vdl-and-sdl"><a href="#what-are-vdl-and-sdl" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are VDL and SDL?</h4> <p><strong>VDL</strong> is <strong>View Definition Language</strong> which represents user views and their mapping to the conceptual schema. <br> <strong>SDL</strong> is <strong>Storage Definition Language</strong> which specifies the mapping between two schemas.<br></p> <h4 id="define-cursor-and-its-types"><a href="#define-cursor-and-its-types" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define Cursor and its types.</h4> <p>Cursor is a temporary work area that stores the data, as well as the result set, occurred after manipulation of data retrieved. A cursor can hold only one row at a time. <br>
The 2 types of Cursor are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Implicit cursors</strong> are declared automatically when DML statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE is executed.</li> <li><strong>Explicit cursors</strong> have to be declared when SELECT statements that are returning more than one row are executed.</li></ul> <h4 id="define-database-lock-and-its-types"><a href="#define-database-lock-and-its-types" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define Database Lock and its types.</h4> <p>Database lock basically signifies the transaction about the current status of the data item i.e. whether that data is being used by other transactions or not at the present point of time. <br>
There are two types of Database lock: <strong>Shared Lock</strong> and <strong>Exclusive Lock</strong>. <br> <strong>Shared Lock</strong> exist when two transactions are granted read access. One transaction gets the shared lock on data and when the second transaction requests the same data it is also given a shared lock. Both transactions are in a read-only mode, updating the data is not allowed until the shared lock is released. <br>
An <strong>Exclusive Lock</strong> means that no other users can update or delete the item until the database server removes the lock.</p> <h4 id="what-is-data-warehousing"><a href="#what-is-data-warehousing" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Data Warehousing?</h4> <p>Data Warehousing integrates data and information collected from various sources into one comprehensive database. For example, a data warehouse might combine customer information from an organization's point-of-sale systems, its mailing lists, website, and comment cards.</p> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-join"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-join" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by Join?</h4> <p>Join is the process of deriving the relationship between different tables by combining columns from one or more tables having common values in each. When a table joins with itself, it is known as Self Join.</p> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-index-hunting"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-index-hunting" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by Index Hunting?</h4> <p>Index hunting is the process of boosting the collection of indexes which helps in improving the query performance as well as the speed of the database (in analogy with direct access by index in a lookup table).</p> <h4 id="how-to-improve-query-performance-using-index-hunting"><a href="#how-to-improve-query-performance-using-index-hunting" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to improve query performance using Index hunting?</h4> <p>Index hunting help in improving query performance by: <br></p> <ul><li>Using a query optimizer to coordinate queries with the workload.</li> <li>Observing the performance and effect of index and query distribution.</li></ul> <h4 id="differentiate-between-‘cluster’-and-‘non-cluster’-index"><a href="#differentiate-between-‘cluster’-and-‘non-cluster’-index" class="header-anchor">#</a> Differentiate between ‘Cluster’ and ‘Non-cluster’ index.</h4> <p><strong>Clustered Index</strong> alters the table and re-order the way in which the records are stored in the table. Data retrieval is made faster by using the clustered index. SQL Server clustered index creates a physical sorted data structure of the table rows according to the defined index key. This sorted data structure is called a B-tree (balanced tree). B-tree structure enables us to find the queried rows faster to using the sorted key value(s). <br>
A <strong>Non-clustered Index</strong> does alter the records that are stored in the table but creates a completely different object within the table.</p> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-fragmentation"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-fragmentation" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by Fragmentation?</h4> <p>Fragmentation is a feature that controls the logical data units, also known as fragments that are stored at different sites of a distributed database system.</p> <h4 id="define-join-types"><a href="#define-join-types" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define Join types.</h4> <p>Given below are the types of Join, which are explained with respect to the tables as an example. <br></p> <p><strong>employee Table</strong></p> <table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left"></th> <th style="text-align:left"></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left"><strong>EmpID</strong></td> <td style="text-align:left"><strong>EmpName</strong></td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1000</td> <td style="text-align:left">Kolya</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1001</td> <td style="text-align:left">Tolya</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1002</td> <td style="text-align:left">Sasha</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1003</td> <td style="text-align:left">Alexey</td></tr></tbody></table> <p><strong>employee_info Table</strong></p> <table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left"></th> <th style="text-align:left"></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left"><strong>EmpID</strong></td> <td style="text-align:left"><strong>Adress</strong></td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1000</td> <td style="text-align:left">Moscow</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1001</td> <td style="text-align:left">Spb</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1002</td> <td style="text-align:left">Nijniy</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">1003</td> <td style="text-align:left">Novosib</td></tr></tbody></table> <ul><li><strong>Inner JOIN:</strong> Inner JOIN is also known as a simple JOIN.

This is not a traditional database or relational database management.</p> <h4 id="how-many-types-of-nosql-databases-are-there"><a href="#how-many-types-of-nosql-databases-are-there" class="header-anchor">#</a> How many types of NoSQL Databases are there?</h4> <ul><li><strong>Graph Database</strong> - stores nodes and relationships instead of tables or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it. For example <strong>Neo4j</strong> is a Graph Database.</li> <li><strong>Key Value Calculation</strong> - stores data as a collection of key-value pairs in which a key serves as a unique identifier. Both keys and values can be anything, ranging from simple objects to complex compound objects. Key-value databases (or key-value stores) are highly partitionable and allow horizontal scaling at a level that other types of databases cannot achieve. Examples are DynamoDB, Cassandra, Redis, etc.</li> <li><strong>Document Oriented</strong> - a special type of Key-Value Store where keys can only be Strings. Moreover, the document is encoded using standards like JSON or related languages like XML (Semi-Structured Data). You can also store PDFs, image files, or text documents directly as values. Examples are CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.</li> <li><strong>Column View Presentation</strong> - represents data in columnar form reducing the number of I/O operations on hardrives. Used in warehouses for big data analytics.</li></ul> <h4 id="write-down-the-difference-between-vertical-and-horizontal-databases"><a href="#write-down-the-difference-between-vertical-and-horizontal-databases" class="header-anchor">#</a> Write down the difference between vertical and horizontal databases.</h4> <p><strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong> means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas <strong>Vertical Scaling</strong> means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.<br>
An easy way to remember this is to think of a machine on a server rack, we add <strong>more machines</strong> across the <strong>horizontal direction</strong> and add <strong>more resources</strong> to a machine in the <strong>vertical direction</strong>. <br>
In the database world, horizontal-scaling is often based on the partitioning of the data i.e. each node contains only part of the data, in vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core i.e. spreading the load between the CPU and RAM resources of that machine.</p> <h4 id="when-should-one-use-nosql-in-place-of-the-normal-database"><a href="#when-should-one-use-nosql-in-place-of-the-normal-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> When should one use NoSQL in place of the normal database?</h4> <p>If you are looking for key-value stores with massive high-speed performances, you can use NoSQL.

The properties of objects or classes within the codebase need to be mapped to their corresponding database table fields.</p> <h4 id="what-is-an-aggregate-oriented-database"><a href="#what-is-an-aggregate-oriented-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is an Aggregate-Oriented Database</h4> <p>Typical Aggregate-Oriented NoSQL databases will store an aggregation in the form of strings or entire documents. That is usually in plain text, often in a specific format or notation, such as JSON or XML. In the case of document NoSQL databases, the “value” portion of the entry can get much larger.</p> <h4 id="what-is-eventual-consistency-in-the-context-of-nosql"><a href="#what-is-eventual-consistency-in-the-context-of-nosql" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is eventual consistency in the context of NoSQL?</h4> <p>Eventual consistency is a data modeling concept that ensures that updates made to distributed NoSQL databases will eventually be reflected across all nodes. This ensures that identical database queries will return the same results after some period of time.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-base-properties-in-nosql"><a href="#what-are-the-base-properties-in-nosql" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the BASE Properties in NoSQL?</h4> <p>BASE Properties aim to handle large volumes of data and enable scalability and flexibility in distributed systems. Here is a breakdown of what each property means:</p> <ul><li><strong>Basically Available:</strong> BASE systems prioritize availability over strong consistency. This means that even in the face of failures or concurrent updates, the system remains operational and accessible to users.</li> <li><strong>Soft State:</strong> BASE systems allow for temporary inconsistency or partial updates. The state of the system can be transiently inconsistent during concurrent updates, but the system is eventually brought back to a consistent state.</li> <li><strong>Eventual Consistency:</strong> BASE systems guarantee that updates will eventually propagate and reach a consistent state across all replicas or nodes. However, immediate consistency is not a requirement, and there may be a delay in achieving consistency.</li></ul> <h4 id="can-normalization-be-used-in-a-nosql-database"><a href="#can-normalization-be-used-in-a-nosql-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> Can Normalization be used in a NoSQL Database?</h4> <p>Yes, normalization can be used by a NoSQL database. One of the famous NoSQL named Cassandra (key-value database) is based on normalization to finding stored data. It creates a series of tables related to the different fields.</p> <h3 id="interview-questions-for-c"><a href="#interview-questions-for-c" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interview questions for C++.</h3> <p><strong>Sources:</strong> <br>

The number of comparisons made is lesser hence, reducing the compile time. Hence, the switch would work better while selecting from a large set of values.</li> <li>When compared to if-else statements, it is more readable. You can also see this in the examples given below.

Operations that are permitted to a pointer are:</p> <ul><li>Increment/Decrement of a Pointer.</li> <li>Addition and Subtraction of integer to a pointer.</li> <li>Comparison of pointers of the same type.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-smart-pointers-enlist-their-types"><a href="#what-are-smart-pointers-enlist-their-types" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are Smart Pointers? Enlist their types.</h4> <p>Smart pointers are defined in the std namespace in the memory.h header file. They are crucial to the RAII or Resource Acquisition Is Initialization programming idiom. The main principle of RAII is to give ownership of any heap-allocated resource—for example, dynamically-allocated memory or system object handles to a stack-allocated object whose destructor contains the code to delete or free the resource and also any associated cleanup code. A smart pointer is a class template that you declare on the stack, and initialize by using a raw pointer that points to a heap-allocated object. After the smart pointer is initialized, it owns the raw pointer. This means that the smart pointer is responsible for deleting the memory that the raw pointer specifies. The smart pointer destructor contains the call to delete, and because the smart pointer is declared on the stack, its destructor is invoked when the smart pointer goes out of scope, even if an exception is thrown somewhere further up the stack.<br></p> <ul><li><strong>unique_ptr</strong> - Allows exactly one owner of the underlying pointer. Can be moved to a new owner, but not copied or shared. This type of smart pointers is small and efficient; the size is one pointer and it supports rvalue references for fast insertion and retrieval from C++ Standard Library collections.</li> <li><strong>shared_ptr</strong> - is a reference-counted smart pointer. Use when you want to assign one raw pointer to multiple owners, for example, when you return a copy of a pointer from a container but want to keep the original. The raw pointer is not deleted until all shared_ptr owners have gone out of scope or have otherwise given up ownership. The size is two pointers; one for the object and one for the shared control block that contains the reference count.</li> <li><strong>weak_ptr</strong> - is a special-case smart pointer for use in conjunction with shared_ptr. A weak_ptr provides access to an object that is owned by one or more shared_ptr instances, but does not participate in reference counting and thus has no ownership of the object. Use when you want to observe an object, but do not require it to remain alive. Required in some cases to break circular references, which can cause memory leaks in structures such as doubly-linked lists or graphs where two objects reference each other using std::shared_ptr. A weak pointer can be created only from a shared pointer.</li></ul> <h4 id="give-an-example-of-circular-dependency-issues-with-std-shared-ptr-and-how-to-resolve-it-with-std-weak-ptr"><a href="#give-an-example-of-circular-dependency-issues-with-std-shared-ptr-and-how-to-resolve-it-with-std-weak-ptr" class="header-anchor">#</a> Give an example of Circular Dependency issues with std::shared_ptr, and how to resolve it with std::weak_ptr.</h4> <p>Consider the following case, where the shared pointers in two separate objects each point at the other object:</p> <div class="language-cpp extra-class"><pre class="language-cpp"><code>    <span class="token macro property"><span class="token directive-hash">#</span><span class="token directive keyword">include</span> <span class="token string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span>

An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function. You declare a pure virtual function by using a <strong>pure specifier (= 0)</strong> in the declaration of a virtual member function in the class declaration.<br>
You cannot use an abstract class as a parameter type, a function return type, or the type of an explicit conversion, nor can you declare an object of an abstract class. However, it can be used to declare pointers and references to an abstract class.<br>
An abstract class is used if you want to provide a common, implemented functionality among all the implementations of the component. Abstract classes will allow you to partially implement your class, whereas interfaces would have no implementation for any members whatsoever. In simple words, Abstract Classes are a good fit if you want to provide implementation details to your children but don’t want to allow an instance of your class to be directly instantiated.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-static-data-members-and-static-member-functions"><a href="#what-are-the-static-data-members-and-static-member-functions" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the static data members and static member functions?</h4> <p>Static data member in C++ are declared inside the class but they are initialized outside of the class.

In simple terms, we can say that Polymorphism is the ability to display a member function in multiple forms depending on the type of object that calls it.
There is 2 type of polymorphism:<br> <strong>Compile Time Polymorphism or Static Binding:</strong><br></p> <ul><li>Function Overloading</li> <li>Operator Overloading <br></li></ul> <p><strong>Run Time Polymorphism or Late Binding:</strong></p> <ul><li>Function Overriding</li> <li>Virtual Function</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-function-overriding"><a href="#what-is-function-overriding" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Function Overriding?</h4> <p>When a function of the same name, same arguments or parameters, and same return type already present/declared in the base class is used in a derived class is known as Function Overriding.

A <strong>Pure Virtual Function</strong> is a member function of a base class only with a declaration provided in the base class and it should be <strong>defined in a derived class</strong> otherwise derived class also becomes abstract.</p> <h4 id="explain-constructors-in-c"><a href="#explain-constructors-in-c" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain Constructors in C++.</h4> <p>A constructor is a special type of member function of a class, whose name is the same as that of the class by whom it is invoked. It initializes value to the object of a class. <br>
There are 4 types of constructors:</p> <ul><li><strong>Default constructor:</strong> It is the most basic type of constructor which accepts no arguments or parameters. Even if it is not called the compiler calls it automatically when an object is created.</li> <li><strong>Parameterized constructor:</strong> It is a type of constructor which accepts arguments or parameters. It has to be called explicitly by passing values in the arguments as these arguments help initialize an object when it is created. It also has the same name as that of the class.</li> <li><strong>Copy Constructor:</strong> A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class. Also, the Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as an argument.</li> <li><strong>Move Constructore:</strong> A move constructor is a special member function that moves ownership of an existing object's data to a new variable without copying the original data.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-the-sequence-of-calling-constructors-in-a-class-hierarhcy"><a href="#what-is-the-sequence-of-calling-constructors-in-a-class-hierarhcy" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the sequence of calling Constructors in a Class Hierarhcy?</h4> <p>A constructor performs its work in this order:</p> <ul><li>It calls base class and member constructors in the order of declaration.</li> <li>If the class is derived from virtual base classes, it initializes the object's virtual base pointers.</li> <li>If the class has or inherits virtual functions, it initializes the object's virtual function pointers.

TMP leverages the compiler’s ability to interpret template parameters as types or values, enabling computation at compile time rather than runtime. This results in more efficient code execution.<br>
In TMP, templates act as both containers of generic algorithms and generators of specific implementations for different data types. The process begins when a programmer defines a template with one or more parameters. During compilation, the compiler generates an appropriate function or class based on the provided arguments.<br>
A key feature of TMP is its recursive nature. A template can call itself with modified parameters until a base case is reached. This recursion happens during compilation, not execution, leading to highly optimized code.<br>
However, TMP has drawbacks such as increased complexity and longer compile times. It also requires deep understanding of C++ syntax and semantics. Despite these challenges, it remains a powerful tool for optimizing performance-critical applications.</p> <h4 id="can-you-discuss-some-of-the-potential-problems-or-challenges-that-can-occur-when-working-with-templates"><a href="#can-you-discuss-some-of-the-potential-problems-or-challenges-that-can-occur-when-working-with-templates" class="header-anchor">#</a> Can you discuss some of the potential problems or challenges that can occur when working with templates?</h4> <p>Templates, while powerful tools in programming, can present several challenges. <br></p> <ul><li>One common issue is <strong>Code Bloat</strong>, where each template instantiation generates a new set of functions or classes, leading to increased binary size. This can also cause <strong>longer compilation times</strong>.<br></li> <li>Another problem is <strong>Debugging Difficulty</strong> due to complex error messages. Templates are instantiated at compile-time and any errors that occur during this process result in verbose and often confusing compiler diagnostics.<br></li> <li><strong>Type Checking Issues</strong> may arise as well. Since templates work with generic types, it’s possible for the programmer to use an inappropriate type, causing unexpected behavior or runtime errors.<br></li> <li>Lastly, there’s the risk of <strong>Poor Abstraction</strong>.

A class template is a blueprint for creating classes. It allows the programmer to define generic types, making it possible to create a class that can work with different data types. For instance, you could have a class template for an array that works with integers, floats, or any other type.<br>
On the other hand, a template class is a specific instance of a class template. When we instantiate a class template with a particular data type, we get a template class. Using our previous example, if we use our array class template to create an array of integers, the resulting class is a template class.</p> <h4 id="how-can-you-create-a-templated-function-within-a-class-in-c"><a href="#how-can-you-create-a-templated-function-within-a-class-in-c" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can you create a templated function within a class in C++?</h4> <p>To create a templated function within a class in C++, you first declare the template above your class. This is done using the ‘template’ keyword followed by ‘T‘ where T is a placeholder for any data type. Inside the class, you can then define your function as usual but use T instead of a specific data type.</p> <div class="language-cpp extra-class"><pre class="language-cpp"><code>    <span class="token keyword">template</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">typename</span> <span class="token class-name">T</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span>

It allows developers to omit explicit template arguments while calling these templates, enhancing code readability and maintainability. The compiler deduces the type based on the provided arguments. For instance, if we have a function template ‘void func(T arg)’ and call it as ‘func(5)’, the compiler deduces T as int. However, this process has limitations. If the deduction leads to ambiguity or no valid match, it fails, causing a compile-time error.</p> <h4 id="can-you-explain-the-difference-between-complete-and-incomplete-template-specialization"><a href="#can-you-explain-the-difference-between-complete-and-incomplete-template-specialization" class="header-anchor">#</a> Can you explain the difference between Complete and Incomplete Template Specialization?</h4> <p>Complete template specialization refers to the process where all template parameters are provided, resulting in a specific type or function. This allows for unique behavior when certain types are used as arguments.<br>
On the other hand, incomplete (or partial) template specialization involves specifying some but not all template parameters.

This is achieved by using the ellipsis operator (…) in template parameters. They are useful for creating generic functions or classes that can handle any number and type of arguments, enhancing code reusability and efficiency. <br>
For instance, consider a simple print function. Without variadic templates, we would need separate versions for different argument counts/types.

Dynamic polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated at run-time as objects of a common parent type. This is useful in scenarios where we have an array or list of objects of the base class type but each needs to execute their version of a function.<br>
Templates wouldn’t work here because they’re resolved at compile-time, while virtual functions are dynamically bound at runtime. Thus, templates can’t provide the dynamic dispatch needed for this kind of polymorphism.</p> <h4 id="how-can-you-prevent-the-instantiation-of-a-template-for-a-particular-data-type"><a href="#how-can-you-prevent-the-instantiation-of-a-template-for-a-particular-data-type" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can you prevent the instantiation of a template for a particular data type?</h4> <p>To prevent the instantiation of a template for a specific data type, you can use explicit specialization or SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error). Explicit specialization allows you to define a different implementation for a particular data type. If this specialized version is not suitable for the given arguments, it won’t be used and will result in a compile error. SFINAE technique involves creating a condition that causes substitution failure if a certain type is used. This can be achieved using std::enable_if or similar meta-programming techniques. For instance:</p> <div class="language-cpp extra-class"><pre class="language-cpp"><code>    <span class="token keyword">template</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">T</span> <span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">typename</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> std<span class="token double-colon punctuation">::</span>enable_if <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">!</span>std<span class="token double-colon punctuation">::</span>is_same<span class="token operator">&lt;</span>T<span class="token punctuation">,</span>Foo<span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token double-colon punctuation">::</span>value<span class="token punctuation">,</span>T<span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token double-colon punctuation">::</span>type <span class="token operator">&gt;</span>

This flexibility can lead to unexpected behavior if the types used don’t support all operations in the template.<br> <strong>Compiler Errors</strong> are another challenge. They often become complex and difficult to understand when templates are involved because compilers generate them based on instantiated templates, not the template definition itself.<br>
Lastly, debugging is complicated by the fact that <strong>templates aren’t fully instantiated until they’re used</strong>. Errors may only appear at this point, making it hard to isolate their source.<br>
To overcome these challenges, use <strong>static assertions</strong> to enforce type requirements. This helps catch errors early and provides clearer messages than those generated by the compiler. Also, consider using <strong>concept checks</strong> (if your language supports them) to specify what operations a type must support to be used with a particular template.<br>
When dealing with <strong>compiler errors</strong>, try <strong>instantiating the problematic template with a specific type</strong>. This can make error messages more understandable.<br>
Finally, for instantiation issues, ensure you <strong>thoroughly test each template with various types</strong>.</p> <h4 id="what-are-template-type-traits-in-c"><a href="#what-are-template-type-traits-in-c" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are Template Type Traits in C++?</h4> <p>Type traits are a feature of C++ that allows performing compile-time analysis of types.

STL has 4 components:</p> <ul><li><strong>Containers</strong></li> <li><strong>Iterators</strong></li> <li><strong>Algorithms</strong></li> <li><strong>Functors</strong></li></ul> <h4 id="enlist-container-types-in-stl"><a href="#enlist-container-types-in-stl" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist Container Types in STL.</h4> <ul><li><strong>Sequence Containers:</strong> implement data structures that can be accessed in a sequential manner.
<ul><li><strong>vector</strong> - is the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itselve automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with its storage being handled automatically by the container. Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes the array may need to be extended. Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.</li> <li><strong>list</strong> - is a sequence container that allows non-contiguous memory allocation. As compared to the vector, the list has slow traversal, but once a position has been found, insertion and deletion are quick (constant time). Normally, when we say a List, we talk about a <strong>doubly linked list</strong>.</li> <li><strong>deque</strong> - Double-ended queues are sequence containers with the feature of expansion and contraction on both ends. They are similar to vectors, but are more efficient in case of insertion and deletion of elements. Unlike vectors, contiguous storage allocation may not be guaranteed.</li> <li><strong>array</strong> - is a class based alternative to common arrays from C-language. It knows its size and cannot decay into a pointer.</li> <li><strong>forward_list</strong> - implements <strong>singly linked list</strong>. The drawback of a forward list is that it cannot be iterated backward and its individual elements cannot be accessed directly.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Container Adaptors:</strong> provide a different interface for sequential containers.
<ul><li><strong>queue</strong> - Queues are a type of container adaptors that operate in a first in first out (FIFO) type of arrangement. Elements are inserted at the back (end) and are deleted from the front. Queues use an encapsulated object of deque or list (sequential container class) as its underlying container, providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements.</li> <li><strong>priority_queue</strong> - A C++ priority queue is a type of container adapter, specifically designed such that the first element of the queue is either the greatest or the smallest of all elements in the queue, and elements are in non-increasing or non-decreasing order (hence we can see that each element of the queue has a priority). In C++ STL, the top element is always the greatest by default. We can also change it to the smallest element at the top. Priority queues are built on the top of the max heap and use an array or vector as an internal structure. In simple terms, STL Priority Queue is the implementation of the <strong>Heap Data Structure</strong>. Heaps are used in <strong>graph algorithms</strong> like Dijkstra’s algorithm and Prim’s algorithm for finding the <strong>shortest paths</strong> and <strong>minimum spanning trees</strong>.</li> <li><strong>stack</strong> - Stacks are a type of container adaptors with LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working, where a new element is added at one end (top) and an element is removed from that end only.  Stack uses an encapsulated object of either vector or deque (by default) or list (sequential container class) as its underlying container, providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Associative Containers:</strong> implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
<ul><li><strong>set</strong> - Sets are a type of associative container in which each element has to be unique because the value of the element identifies it (the value is a key). The values are stored in a specific sorted order i.e. either ascending or descending. They are implemented as <strong>BST (Binary Search Trees)</strong>.</li> <li><strong>multiset</strong> - A multiset is a container in C++ that allows you to store multiple occurrences of the same value in a sorted order. It is part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and is implemented as a <strong>Balanced Binary Search Tree</strong>.</li> <li><strong>map</strong> - Maps are associative containers that store elements in a mapped fashion. Each element has a key value and a mapped value. No two mapped values can have the same key values. Maps are implemented by self-balancing search trees. In C++ STL it uses <strong>Red-Black Tree</strong>.</li> <li><strong>multimap</strong> - Multimap is similar to a map with the addition that multiple elements can have the same keys. Also, it is NOT required that the key-value and mapped value pair have to be unique in this case. One important thing to note about multimap is that multimap keeps all the keys in sorted order always.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Unordered Associative Containers:</strong> implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched
<ul><li><strong>unordered_set</strong> - An unordered_set is an unordered associative container implemented using a <strong>Hash Table</strong> where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table so that the insertion is always randomized.</li> <li><strong>unordered_multiset</strong> - The unordered_multiset in C++ STL is an unordered associative container that works similarly to an unordered_set. The only difference is that we can store multiple copies of the same key in this container. It is also implemented using a <strong>Hash Table</strong> so the time complexity of the operations is O(1) on average which can go up to linear time O(n) in the worst case. Internally when an existing value is inserted, the data structure increases its count which is associated with each value. A count of each value is stored in unordered_multiset, it takes more space than unordered_set (if all values are distinct).</li> <li><strong>unordered_map</strong> - is an associated container that stores elements formed by the combination of a key value and a mapped value. The key value is used to uniquely identify the element and the mapped value is the content associated with the key. Both key and value can be of any type predefined or user-defined. In simple terms, an unordered_map is like a data structure of dictionary type that stores elements in itself. It contains successive pairs (key, value), which allows fast retrieval of an individual element based on its unique key. Internally unordered_map is implemented using <strong>Hash Table</strong>, the key provided to map is hashed into indices of a hash table which is why the performance of data structure depends on the hash function a lot but on average, the cost of search, insert, and delete from the hash table is O(1).</li> <li><strong>unordered_multimap</strong> - the same as <strong>unordered_map</strong>, but allows duplicates of key-value pairs.</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-an-iterator-in-stl"><a href="#what-is-an-iterator-in-stl" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is an Iterator in STL?</h4> <p>An iterator is an object (like a pointer) that points to an element inside the container. We can use iterators to move through the contents of the container. They can be visualized as something similar to a pointer pointing to some location and we can access the content at that particular location using them.<br>
There are 5 types of iterators:</p> <ul><li><strong>Input Iterators:</strong> They are the weakest of all the iterators and have very limited functionality. They can only be used in a single-pass algorithms, i.e., those algorithms which process the container sequentially, such that no element is accessed more than once.</li> <li><strong>Output Iterators:</strong> Just like input iterators, they are also very limited in their functionality and can only be used in single-pass algorithm to modify the elements.</li> <li><strong>Forward Iterators:</strong> They are higher in the hierarchy than input and output iterators, and contain all the features present in these two iterators. But, as the name suggests, they also can only move in a forward direction one step at a time.</li> <li><strong>Bidirectional Iterators:</strong> They have all the features of forward iterators along with the fact that they overcome the drawback of forward iterators, as they can move in both the directions, that is why their name is bidirectional.</li> <li><strong>Random-Access Iterators:</strong> They are the most powerful iterators. They are not limited to moving sequentially, as their name suggests, they can randomly access any element inside the container. They are the ones whose functionality are same as pointers.</li></ul> <table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left"></th> <th style="text-align:left"></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left"><strong>STL Container</strong></td> <td style="text-align:left"><strong>Types of iterators supported</strong></td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Vector</td> <td style="text-align:left">Random-Access</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">List</td> <td style="text-align:left">Bidirectional</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Deque</td> <td style="text-align:left">Random-Access</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Map</td> <td style="text-align:left">Bidirectional</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Multimap</td> <td style="text-align:left">Bidirectional</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Set</td> <td style="text-align:left">Bidirectional</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Multiset</td> <td style="text-align:left">Bidirectional</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Unordered-Map</td> <td style="text-align:left">Forward</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Unordered-Multimap</td> <td style="text-align:left">Forward</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Unordered-Set</td> <td style="text-align:left">Forward</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:left">Unordered-Multiset</td> <td style="text-align:left">Forward</td></tr></tbody></table> <h4 id="give-an-overview-of-algorithms-in-stl"><a href="#give-an-overview-of-algorithms-in-stl" class="header-anchor">#</a> Give an overview of Algorithms in STL.</h4> <p>The header algorithm defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements. They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers. <br></p> <ul><li><strong>Sorting</strong> - There is a built-in function in C++ STL by the name of <strong>sort()</strong>. This function internally uses IntroSort. In more details it is implemented using hybrid of QuickSort, HeapSort and InsertionSort. By default, it uses QuickSort but if QuickSort is doing unfair partitioning, it switches to HeapSort and when the array size becomes really small, it switches to InsertionSort.</li> <li><strong>Searching</strong> - <strong>Binary Search</strong> in a sorted array <strong>binary_search(startaddress, endaddress, valuetofind)</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Partition Operations</strong> - C++ has a class in its STL algorithms library which allows us easy partition algorithms using certain built-in functions. Partition refers to act of dividing elements of containers depending upon a given condition.<br>
Partition operations :
<ul><li><strong>partition(beg, end, condition)</strong> - This function is used to partition the elements on basis of condition mentioned in its arguments.</li> <li><strong>is_partitioned(beg, end, condition)</strong> - This function returns boolean true if container is partitioned else returns false.</li></ul></li> <li>Some other important STL algorithms:
<ul><li><strong>reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator)</strong> – To reverse a sequencial container. ( if ascending -&gt; descending  OR  if descending -&gt; ascending)</li> <li>*<strong>max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator)</strong> – to find the maximum element of a container.</li> <li>*<strong>min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator)</strong> – to find the minimum element of a container.</li> <li><strong>accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum)</strong> – does the summation of container elements.</li> <li><strong>count(first_iterator, last_iterator,x)</strong> – To count the occurrences of x in a container.</li> <li><strong>find(first_iterator, last_iterator, x)</strong> – Returns an iterator to the first occurrence of x in a container and points to end of the container ((name_of_vector).end()) if element is not present in it.</li> <li><strong>lower_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x)</strong> – returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last) which has a value not less than ‘x’.</li> <li><strong>upper_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x)</strong> – returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last) which has a value greater than ‘x’.</li> <li><strong>next_permutation(first_iterator, last_iterator)</strong> – modifies the container to its next permutation.</li> <li><strong>prev_permutation(first_iterator, last_iterator)</strong> – modifies the container to its previous permutation.</li> <li><strong>distance(first_iterator,desired_position)</strong> – It returns the distance of desired position from the first iterator.This function is very useful while finding the index.</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-concurrency-in-programming"><a href="#what-is-concurrency-in-programming" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Concurrency in Programming?</h4> <p>In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome.</p> <h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism"><a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the difference between Concurrency and Parallelism?</h4> <p>Concurrency is about multiple tasks which start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, in no specific order. Parallelism is about multiple tasks or subtasks of the same task that literally run at the same time on a hardware with multiple computing resources like multi-core processor.</p> <h4 id="elist-errors-and-risks-associated-with-concurency"><a href="#elist-errors-and-risks-associated-with-concurency" class="header-anchor">#</a> Elist Errors and Risks associated with Concurency.</h4> <p>Concurrent multithreading applications need to be carefully designed as it is prone to many errors leading to undefined behaviour. Some of these errors are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Race Conditions</strong> - happen when two or more threads access shared data concurrently leading to the undefined behaviour.</li> <li><strong>Deadlocks</strong> - refer to the situation where two or more threads are blocked forever waiting for each other. The careful synchronization is essential to prevent deadlocks.</li> <li><strong>Starvation</strong> - is the condition where a thread is unable to gain regular access to the shared resources.</li></ul> <h4 id="enlist-libraries-and-instruments-for-realizing-concurrency-in-c"><a href="#enlist-libraries-and-instruments-for-realizing-concurrency-in-c" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist Libraries and Instruments for realizing Concurrency in C++.</h4> <p>In C++, the support for concurrency was first added in C++ 11 to improve the performance of the program and enable multitasking. The components such as thread, mutex, memory model, and various synchronization primitives were added as the part of Concurrency Support Library.</p> <ul><li><strong>Threads</strong> - Threads are the basic unit of multitasking. The concurrent execution of the tasks is done by creating multiple threads in a multithreaded environment. The C++ provides a <code>thread</code> library for creating and managing threads.</li> <li><strong>Thread Synchronization</strong> - Thread synchronization can be done using the following components provided in C++:
<ul><li><strong>Mutex and Locks</strong> - The Mutual Exclusion and Locks are used to protect shared resources. Ensures that only one thread accesses critical sections at a time. C++ have <code>mutex</code> header file which contains the <code>std::mutex</code> classes.</li> <li><strong>Condition Variables</strong> - are used for thread synchronization by acting as a flag that notifies the threads when the shared resources are free. C++ have <code>condition_variable</code> header that contains the <code>condition_variable</code> object.</li> <li><strong>Futures and Promises</strong> - <code>future</code> and <code>promise</code> are used for asynchronous task execution. This method is only viable when thread tasks are independent of each other.</li> <li><strong>Semaphores</strong> - are also a synchronization primitive that counts the number of threads accessing the shared resource. If this count exceeds the number of accesses available, the semaphore will block the access till the count is freed.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Thread Pool</strong> - normal threads have to be manually managed regarding their lifecycle and the associated functions. Thread Pools contain automatically managed threads with an API that allows adding tasks into a work queue of pending tasks. The pool feeds from the queue as soon as slot is available. <code>std::future</code> can be used to wait for tasks to be completed.</li> <li><strong>Atomic Operation</strong> - indivisible operation. It cannot be observed half-done from any thread in the system. If one thread writes to an atomic object while another thread reads from it, the behavior is well-defined. Atomics allow writting lock-free multithreading, meaning there is no need to use any synchronization primitive.</li> <li><strong>Coroutines</strong> - A coroutine is a function that can suspend execution to be resumed later. Coroutines are stackless: they suspend execution by returning to the caller and the data that is required to resume execution is stored separately from the stack. This allows for sequential code that executes asynchronously (e.g. to handle non-blocking I/O without explicit callbacks), and also supports algorithms on lazy-computed infinite sequences and other uses.</li></ul> <h4 id="give-an-example-of-a-race-condition-in-c"><a href="#give-an-example-of-a-race-condition-in-c" class="header-anchor">#</a> Give an example of a Race Condition in C++.</h4> <p>Following code shows a situation of race condition if thread synchronization by locking mutex is not present:</p> <div class="language-cpp extra-class"><pre class="language-cpp"><code>    <span class="token macro property"><span class="token directive-hash">#</span><span class="token directive keyword">include</span> <span class="token string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span>

</code></pre></div><h4 id="enlist-types-of-mutexes"><a href="#enlist-types-of-mutexes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist types of Mutexes.</h4> <p>There are three basic types of mutual exclusion:</p> <ul><li><p><code>std::mutex</code> – is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. Mutex offers exclusive, non-recursive ownership semantics:</p> <ul><li>A calling thread owns a mutex from the time that it successfully calls either <code>lock</code> or <code>try_lock</code> until it calls <code>unlock</code>.</li> <li>When a thread owns a mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to <code>lock</code>) or receive a false return value (for <code>try_lock</code>) if they attempt to claim ownership of the mutex.</li> <li>A calling thread must not own the mutex prior to calling lock or try_lock.</li></ul> <p>The behavior of a program is undefined if a mutex is destroyed while still owned by any threads, or a thread terminates while owning a mutex. This type of mutex can be locked only once even by an owning thread, otherwise Deadlock condition arises.</p></li> <li><p><code>std::recursive_mutex</code> – is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. <code>recursive_mutex</code> offers exclusive, recursive ownership semantics:</p> <ul><li>A calling thread owns a <code>recursive_mutex</code> for a period of time that starts when it successfully calls either <code>lock</code> or <code>try_lock</code>. During this period, the thread may make additional calls to <code>lock</code> or <code>try_lock</code>. The period of ownership ends when the thread makes a matching number of calls to <code>unlock</code>.</li> <li>When a thread owns a <code>recursive_mutex</code>, all other threads will block (for calls to <code>lock</code>) or receive a false return value (for <code>try_lock</code>) if they attempt to claim ownership of the <code>recursive_mutex</code>.</li> <li>The maximum number of times that a <code>recursive_mutex</code> may be locked is unspecified, but after that number is reached, calls to lock will throw <code>std::system_error</code> and calls to <code>try_lock</code> will return false.</li></ul> <p>The behavior of a program is undefined if a recursive_mutex is destroyed while still owned by some thread.</p></li> <li><p><code>std::shared_mutex</code> - is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. In contrast to other mutex types which facilitate exclusive access, a shared_mutex has two levels of access:</p> <ul><li>shared - several threads can share ownership of the same mutex.</li> <li>exclusive - only one thread can own the mutex.</li></ul> <p>If one thread has acquired the exclusive lock (through <code>lock</code>, <code>try_lock</code>), no other threads can acquire the lock (including the shared).<br>
If one thread has acquired the shared lock (through <code>lock_shared</code>, <code>try_lock_shared</code>), no other thread can acquire the exclusive lock, but can acquire the shared lock.<br>
Only when the exclusive lock has not been acquired by any thread, the shared lock can be acquired by multiple threads.<br>
Within one thread, only one lock (shared or exclusive) can be acquired at the same time.<br>
Shared mutexes are especially useful when shared data can be safely read by any number of threads simultaneously, but a thread may only write the same data when no other thread is reading or writing at the same time.</p></li></ul> <h4 id="enlist-types-of-raii-resource-acquisition-is-initialization-wrappers-of-mutex-locks"><a href="#enlist-types-of-raii-resource-acquisition-is-initialization-wrappers-of-mutex-locks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist types of RAII(Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) Wrappers of Mutex Locks.</h4> <p>There are mainly three types of such wrappers:</p> <ul><li><code>std::unique_lock</code> - is a general-purpose mutex ownership wrapper allowing deferred locking, time-constrained attempts at locking, recursive locking, transfer of lock ownership, and use with condition variables. The class <code>unique_lock</code> is movable, but not copyable.</li> <li><code>std::shared_lock</code> - is a general-purpose shared mutex ownership wrapper allowing deferred locking, timed locking and transfer of lock ownership. Locking a <code>shared_lock</code> locks the associated shared mutex in shared mode (to lock it in exclusive mode, <code>std::unique_lock</code> can be used). The shared_lock class is movable, but not copyable.</li> <li><code>std::scoped_lock</code> - is a mutex wrapper that provides a convenient RAII-style mechanism for owning zero or more mutexes for the duration of a scoped block.<br>
When a <code>scoped_lock</code> object is created, it attempts to take ownership of the mutexes it is given. When control leaves the scope in which the <code>scoped_lock</code> object was created, the <code>scoped_lock</code> is destructed and the mutexes are released. If several mutexes are given, deadlock avoidance algorithm is used as if by <code>std::lock</code>.<br>
The <code>scoped_lock</code> class is non-copyable.</li></ul> <h4 id="give-some-examples-of-deadlocks-and-how-to-avoid-them"><a href="#give-some-examples-of-deadlocks-and-how-to-avoid-them" class="header-anchor">#</a> Give some examples of Deadlocks and how to avoid them.</h4> <p>The following code will deadlock since <code>std::mutex</code> can be locked at most once:</p> <div class="language-cpp extra-class"><pre class="language-cpp"><code>    <span class="token macro property"><span class="token directive-hash">#</span><span class="token directive keyword">include</span> <span class="token string">&lt;mutex&gt;</span></span>

www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-interview-questions/ <br></p> <h4 id="what-is-python-what-are-the-benfits-of-using-it"><a href="#what-is-python-what-are-the-benfits-of-using-it" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Python? What are the benfits of using it?</h4> <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language. It can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.<br>
Benefits of using Python:</p> <ul><li>Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.</li> <li>Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application Development and deployment.</li></ul> <h4 id="explain-interpreted-programming-language"><a href="#explain-interpreted-programming-language" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain Interpreted Programming Language.</h4> <p>An interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-dynamically-typed-language"><a href="#what-is-a-dynamically-typed-language" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a dynamically typed language?</h4> <p>Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a strongly-typed language, such as Python, &quot;1&quot; + 2 will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for &quot;type-coercion&quot; (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output &quot;12&quot; as a result.<br>
Type-checking can be done at two stages:</p> <ul><li>Static - Data Types are checked before execution.</li> <li>Dynamic - Data Types are checked during execution.<br></li></ul> <p>Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.</p> <h4 id="what-is-pep-8-and-why-is-it-important"><a href="#what-is-pep-8-and-why-is-it-important" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is PEP 8 and why is it important?</h4> <p>PEP stands for <strong>Python Enhancement Proposal</strong>. A PEP is an official design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 is especially important since it documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing to the Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely and strictly.</p> <h4 id="what-is-scope-in-python"><a href="#what-is-scope-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Scope in Python?</h4> <p>Every object in Python functions within a scope. A scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant. Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects inside a program. However, these namespaces also have a scope defined for them where you could use their objects without any prefix. A few examples of scope created during code execution in Python are as follows:</p> <ul><li>A <strong>Local Scope</strong> refers to the local objects available in the current function.</li> <li>A <strong>Global Scope</strong> refers to the objects available throughout the code execution since their inception.</li> <li>A <strong>Module-level Scope</strong> refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program.</li> <li>An <strong>Outermost Scope</strong> refers to all the built-in names callable in the program. The objects in this scope are searched last to find the name referenced.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-mutable-and-immutable-data-types-in-pyhon"><a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-mutable-and-immutable-data-types-in-pyhon" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the difference between Mutable and Immutable Data Types in Pyhon?</h4> <p>Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime. Eg – List, Dictionary, etc. Immutable data types can not be edited i.e., they can not change at runtime. Eg – String, Tuple, Byte and all single value built-in types.</p> <h4 id="what-are-lists-and-tuples-what-is-the-key-difference-between-the-two"><a href="#what-are-lists-and-tuples-what-is-the-key-difference-between-the-two" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are lists and tuples? What is the key difference between the two?</h4> <p>Lists and Tuples are both sequence data types that can store a collection of objects in Python. The objects stored in both sequences can have different data types. Lists are represented with square brackets ['sara', 6, 0.19], while tuples are represented with parantheses ('ansh', 5, 0.97). The key difference between the two is that while lists are mutable, tuples on the other hand are immutable objects. This means that lists can be modified, appended or sliced on the go but tuples remain constant and cannot be modified in any manner.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-common-built-in-data-types-in-python"><a href="#what-are-the-common-built-in-data-types-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the common built-in data types in Python?</h4> <p>There are several built-in data types in Python. Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected. Python provides <code>type()</code> and <code>isinstance()</code> functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories:</p> <ul><li><strong>None Type:</strong> represents the null values in Python. Boolean equality operation can be performed using these NoneType objects.</li> <li><strong>Numeric Types:</strong> there are three distinct numeric types - <strong>integers</strong>, <strong>floating-point numbers</strong>, and <strong>complex numbers</strong>. Additionally, <strong>booleans</strong> are a sub-type of integers.</li> <li><strong>Sequence Types:</strong> there are four kinds of sequence data types: <strong>list</strong> (matable), <strong>tuple</strong> (immutable), <strong>range</strong> (immutable) and <strong>str</strong>(immutable).</li> <li><strong>Mapping Types:</strong> <strong>dict</strong> (dictionary) is mutable data type that stores key-value pairs. Implemented as a <strong>Hash Map</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Set Types:</strong> Currently, Python has two built-in types - <strong>set</strong> and <strong>frozenset</strong>. <strong>set</strong> type is mutable and supports methods like add() and remove(). <strong>frozenset</strong> type is immutable and can't be modified after creation.</li> <li><strong>Modules:</strong> is an additional built-in type supported by the Python Interpreter. It supports one special operation, i.e., attribute access: <code>mymod.myobj</code>, where <code>mymod</code> is a module and <code>myobj</code> references a name defined in m's symbol table. The module's symbol table resides in a very special attribute of the module <strong>dict</strong>, but direct assignment to this module is neither possible nor recommended.</li> <li><strong>Callable Types:</strong> Callable types are the types to which function call can be applied. They can be <strong>user-defined functions</strong>, <strong>instance methods</strong>, <strong>generator functions</strong> and some other built-in functions, methods and classes.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-pass-in-python"><a href="#what-is-pass-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is <code>pass</code> in Python?</h4> <p>The <code>pass</code> keyword represents a null operation in Python.

Why are they used?</h4> <p>A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict. Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same name and map it to a separate object. A few examples of namespaces are as follows:</p> <ul><li><strong>Local Namespace</strong> includes local names inside a function. The namespace is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared when the function returns.</li> <li><strong>Global Namespace</strong> includes names from various imported packages/ modules that are being used in the current project. This namespace is created when the package is imported in the script and lasts until the execution of the script.</li> <li><strong>Built-in Namespace</strong> includes built-in functions of core Python and built-in names for various types of exceptions.</li></ul> <p>The lifecycle of a namespace depends upon the scope of objects they are mapped to. If the scope of an object ends, the lifecycle of that namespace comes to an end.

Whereas, .pyc file contains the bytecode of your program. We get bytecode after compilation of .py file (source code). .pyc files are not created for all the files that you run. It is only created for the files that you import.</li> <li>Before executing a python program python interpreter checks for the compiled files. If the file is present, the virtual machine executes it. If not found, it checks for .py file. If found, compiles it to .pyc file and then python virtual machine executes it.</li> <li>Having .pyc file saves you the compilation time.</li></ul> <h4 id="how-python-is-interpreted"><a href="#how-python-is-interpreted" class="header-anchor">#</a> How Python is interpreted?</h4> <ul><li>Python as a language is not interpreted or compiled. Interpreted or compiled is the property of the implementation. Python is a bytecode(set of interpreter readable instructions) interpreted generally.</li> <li>Source code is a file with .py extension.</li> <li>Python compiles the source code to a set of instructions for a virtual machine. The Python interpreter is an implementation of that virtual machine. This intermediate format is called “bytecode”.</li> <li>.py source code is first compiled to give .pyc which is bytecode. This bytecode can be then interpreted by the official CPython or JIT(Just in Time compiler) compiled by PyPy.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-iterators-in-python"><a href="#what-are-iterators-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are iterators in Python?</h4> <ul><li>An iterator is an object.</li> <li>It remembers its state i.e., where it is during iteration (see code below to see how)</li> <li><code>__iter__()</code> method initializes an iterator.</li> <li>It has a <code>__next__()</code> method which returns the next item in iteration and points to the next element.

It has the concept of imitating the behaviour of variables by making use of a single (protected) or double underscore (private) as prefixed to the variable names. By default, the variables without prefixed underscores are public.</p> <h4 id="is-it-possible-to-call-parent-class-without-its-instance-creation"><a href="#is-it-possible-to-call-parent-class-without-its-instance-creation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Is it possible to call parent class without its instance creation?</h4> <p>Yes, it is possible if the base class is instantiated by other child classes or if the base class is a static method.</p> <h4 id="how-is-an-empty-class-created-in-python"><a href="#how-is-an-empty-class-created-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> How is an empty class created in python?</h4> <p>An empty class does not have any members defined in it. It is created by using the <code>pass</code> keyword (the pass command does nothing in python). We can create objects for this class outside the class.</p> <h4 id="what-is-polymorphism-in-python"><a href="#what-is-polymorphism-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Polymorphism in Python?</h4> <p>Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. So, for instance, if the parent class has a method named ABC then the child class also can have a method with the same name ABC having its own parameters and variables. Python allows polymorphism.</p> <h4 id="differentiate-between-new-and-override-modifiers"><a href="#differentiate-between-new-and-override-modifiers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Differentiate between new and override modifiers.</h4> <p>The <code>new</code> modifier is used to instruct the compiler to use the new implementation and not the base class function. The <code>override</code> modifier is useful for overriding a base class function inside the child class.</p> <h4 id="how-will-you-check-if-a-class-is-a-child-of-another-class"><a href="#how-will-you-check-if-a-class-is-a-child-of-another-class" class="header-anchor">#</a> How will you check if a class is a child of another class?</h4> <p>This is done by using a method called <code>issubclass()</code> provided by python. The method tells us if any class is a child of another class by returning true or false accordingly.</p> <h4 id="define-encapsulation-in-python"><a href="#define-encapsulation-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define encapsulation in Python?</h4> <p>Encapsulation means binding the code and the data together. A Python class is an example of encapsulation.</p> <h4 id="how-do-you-do-data-abstraction-in-python"><a href="#how-do-you-do-data-abstraction-in-python" class="header-anchor">#</a> How do you do data abstraction in Python?</h4> <p>Data Abstraction is providing only the required details and hides the implementation from the world.

Generally, Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements. This means that in python only one thread will be executed at a time. The performance of the single-threaded process and the multi-threaded process will be the same in python and this is because of GIL in python. We can not achieve multithreading in python because we have global interpreter lock which restricts the threads and works as a single thread.</p> <h3 id="interview-questions-for-machine-learning"><a href="#interview-questions-for-machine-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interview questions for Machine Learning.</h3> <h3 id="interview-questions-for-deep-learning"><a href="#interview-questions-for-deep-learning" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interview questions for Deep Learning.</h3> <h3 id="interview-questions-for-computer-vision"><a href="#interview-questions-for-computer-vision" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interview questions for Computer Vision.</h3> <h3 id="interview-questions-for-software-engineering-architecture-and-design"><a href="#interview-questions-for-software-engineering-architecture-and-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interview questions for Software Engineering, Architecture and Design.</h3></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
