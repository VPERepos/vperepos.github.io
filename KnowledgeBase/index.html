Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required.<br></li> <li><strong>List</strong> - a linked list is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.<br></li> <li><strong>Record</strong> - a record (also <strong>called tuple</strong> or <strong>struct</strong>) is an <strong>aggregate data structure</strong>. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects. <br></li> <li><strong>Hash tables</strong> -  also known as hash maps, are data structures that provide fast retrieval of values based on keys. They use a hashing function to map keys to indexes in an array, allowing for constant-time access in the average case. Hash tables are commonly used in dictionaries, caches, and database indexing. However, hash collisions can occur, which can impact their performance. Techniques like chaining and open addressing are employed to handle collisions.<br></li> <li><strong>Graphs</strong> - collections of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between entities. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have cycles or be acyclic.<br></li> <li><strong>Stacks and queues</strong> - abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. A stack has two primary operations: push (adds an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removes the topmost element from the stack), that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Queues have two main operations: enqueue (adds an element to the rear of the queue) and dequeue (removes an element from the front of the queue) that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.<br></li> <li><strong>Trees</strong> - represent a hierarchical organization of elements. A tree consists of nodes connected by edges, with one node being the root and all other nodes forming subtrees. <strong>Binary trees</strong> (particularly heaps), <strong>AVL trees</strong>, and <strong>B-trees</strong> are some popular types of trees. They enable efficient and optimal searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation of data.</li> <li><strong>Trie</strong> - also known as a <strong>prefix tree</strong>, is a specialized tree data structure used for the efficient retrieval of strings. Tries store characters of a string as nodes, with each edge representing a character. They are particularly useful in text processing scenarios like autocomplete, spell-checking, and dictionary implementations. Tries enable fast searching and prefix-based operations on strings.<br></li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-linear-data-structure-name-a-few-examples"><a href="#what-is-a-linear-data-structure-name-a-few-examples" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Linear Data Structure? Name a few examples.</h4> <p>A data structure is linear if all its elements or data items are arranged in a sequence or a linear order. The elements are stored in a <strong>non-hierarchical way</strong> so that each item has successors and predecessors except the first and last element in the list.
Examples of linear data structures are <strong>Array</strong>, <strong>Stack</strong>, <strong>Queue</strong>, and <strong>Linked List</strong>.<br></p> <h4 id="how-are-the-elements-of-a-2d-array-stored-in-the-memory"><a href="#how-are-the-elements-of-a-2d-array-stored-in-the-memory" class="header-anchor">#</a> How are the elements of a 2D Array stored in the memory.</h4> <ul><li><strong>Row-Major Order</strong>: In row-major ordering, the first row of a 2D array is entirely stored in memory, followed by the second row of the array, and so on until the final row.</li> <li><strong>Column-Major Order</strong>: In column-major ordering, the first column of the array is entirely saved in memory, followed by the second row of the array, and so on until the last column of the array is fully recorded in the memory.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-some-use-cases-for-row-major-and-column-major-storing-of-2d-arrays"><a href="#what-are-some-use-cases-for-row-major-and-column-major-storing-of-2d-arrays" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are some use cases for Row-Major and Column-Major storing of 2D Arrays?</h4> <p><strong>Row-Major</strong> stored arrays are more efficient for row-wise access like in <strong>Image Processing</strong>. <strong>Column-Major</strong> stored arrays are more efficient for column-wise access like for <strong>Matrix Multiplication</strong>.<br></p> <h4 id="how-can-you-possibly-choose-between-row-major-and-column-major-2d-arrays-storing-implementations"><a href="#how-can-you-possibly-choose-between-row-major-and-column-major-2d-arrays-storing-implementations" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can you possibly choose between Row-Major and Column-Major 2D Arrays storing implementations?</h4> <p>By choosing a <strong>programming language</strong>. <strong>Row-Major</strong> is implemented in languages like C/C++ and <strong>Column-Major</strong> - in Fortran.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-linked-list-data-structure"><a href="#what-is-a-linked-list-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Linked List Data Structure?</h4> <p>It’s a both <strong>linear and non-linear Data Structure</strong>, depending on application, or a sequence of data objects where <strong>elements are not stored in adjacent memory locations</strong>. The elements are linked using pointers to form a chain. Each element is a separate object, called a node.  Each node has two items: a data field and a reference to the next node. The entry point in a linked list is called the head. Where the list is empty, the head is a null reference and the last node has a reference to null. A linked list is a dynamic data structure, where the number of nodes is not fixed, and the list has the ability to grow and shrink on demand.
It is applied in cases where:</p> <ul><li>We deal with an unknown number of objects or don’t know how many items are in the list</li> <li>We need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list, as in real-time computing where time predictability is critical</li> <li>Random access to any elements is not needed</li> <li>The algorithm requires a data structure where objects need to be stored irrespective of their physical address in memory</li> <li>We need to insert items in the middle of the list as in a priority queue
<br></li></ul> <h4 id="are-linked-lists-considered-linear-or-non-linear-data-structures"><a href="#are-linked-lists-considered-linear-or-non-linear-data-structures" class="header-anchor">#</a> Are Linked Lists considered Linear or Non-linear Data Structures?</h4> <p>Linked lists are considered both linear and non-linear data structures depending upon the application they are used for. When used for access strategies, it is considered as a linear data-structure. When used for data storage, it is considered a non-linear data structure.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-a-linked-list-over-an-array-in-which-scenarios-do-we-use-linked-list-and-when-array"><a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-a-linked-list-over-an-array-in-which-scenarios-do-we-use-linked-list-and-when-array" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the advantages of a Linked List over an Array? In which scenarios do we use Linked List and when Array?</h4> <p>Advantages of a linked list over an array are:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Insertion and Deletion</strong><br>
Insertion and deletion of nodes is an easier process, as we only update the address present in the next pointer of a node. It’s expensive to do the same in an array as the room has to be created for the new elements and existing elements must be shifted.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Dynamic Data Structure</strong><br>
As a linked list is a dynamic data structure, there is no need to give an initial size as it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory. However, the size is limited in an array as the number of elements is statically stored in the main memory.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>No wastage of Memory</strong><br>
As the size of a linked list can increase or decrease depending on the demands of the program, and memory is allocated only when required, there is no memory wasted. In the case of an array, there is memory wastage. For instance, if we declare an array of size 10 and store only five elements in it, then the space for five elements is wasted.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Implementation</strong><br>
Data structures like stack and queues are more easily implemented using a linked list than an array.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Some scenarios where we use linked list over array are</strong>:</p> <ul><li>When we do not know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance</li> <li>When there are a large number of add or remove operations</li> <li>When there are no large number of random access to elements</li> <li>When we want to insert items in the middle of the list, such as when implementing a priority queue<br></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Some scenarios in which we use array over the linked list are</strong>:</p> <ul><li>When we need to index or randomly access elements</li> <li>When we know the number of elements in the array beforehand, so we can allocate the correct amount of memory</li> <li>When we need speed when iterating through all the elements in the sequence</li> <li>When memory is a concern; filled arrays use less memory than linked lists, as each element in the array is the data but each linked list node requires the data as well as one or more pointers to the other elements in the linked list
<br></li></ul></li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-doubly-linked-list"><a href="#what-is-a-doubly-linked-list" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Doubly-Linked List?</h4> <p>It is a complex type (double-ended LL) of a linked list in which a node has two links, one that connects to the next node in the sequence and another that connects to the previous node. This allows traversal across the data elements in both directions.<br></p> <h4 id="what-are-dynamic-data-structures-name-a-few"><a href="#what-are-dynamic-data-structures-name-a-few" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are Dynamic Data Structures? Name a few.</h4> <p>They are collections of data in memory that expand and contract to grow or shrink in size as a program runs. This enables the programmer to control exactly how much memory is to be utilized. Examples are the <strong>dynamic array</strong>, <strong>linked list</strong>, <strong>stack</strong>, <strong>queue</strong>, and <strong>heap</strong>.<br></p> <h4 id="what-is-a-stack"><a href="#what-is-a-stack" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Stack?</h4> <p>A stack is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure, as in a real physical stack or piles where you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things. Thus, insertion (push) and deletion (pop) of items take place only at one end called top of the stack, with a particular order: LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).</p> <h4 id="where-are-stacks-used"><a href="#where-are-stacks-used" class="header-anchor">#</a> Where are Stacks used?</h4> <ul><li>Expression, evaluation, or conversion of evaluating prefix, postfix, and infix expressions</li> <li>Syntax parsing</li> <li>String reversal</li> <li>Parenthesis checking</li> <li>Backtracking</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-the-operations-that-can-be-performed-on-a-stack"><a href="#what-are-the-operations-that-can-be-performed-on-a-stack" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the operations that can be performed on a Stack?</h4> <p>A stack may perform three fundamental operations:</p> <ul><li>PUSH: The push action inserts a new element into the stack. The new feature is placed at the top of the stack.</li> <li>POP: The pop operation is performed to remove the stack's topmost element.</li> <li>PEEK: A peek action returns the value of the stack's topmost element without removing it from the stack.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-queue-data-structure"><a href="#what-is-a-queue-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a queue Data Structure?</h4> <p>A queue is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure or an ordered list,  using the First In First Out (FIFO) operation to access elements. Insert operations can be performed only at one end called REAR and delete operations can be performed only at the other end called FRONT.</p> <h4 id="list-some-applications-of-the-queue-data-structure"><a href="#list-some-applications-of-the-queue-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> List some applications of the Queue Data Structure.</h4> <p>To prioritize jobs as in the following scenarios:</p> <ul><li>As waiting lists for a single shared resource (like printer, CPU, call center systems).</li> <li>In the asynchronous transfer of data (file IO, sockets).</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-a-dequeue"><a href="#what-is-a-dequeue" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Dequeue?</h4> <p>It is a double-ended queue, or a data structure, where the elements can be inserted or deleted at both ends (FRONT and REAR).</p> <h4 id="what-operations-can-be-performed-on-queues"><a href="#what-operations-can-be-performed-on-queues" class="header-anchor">#</a> What operations can be performed on Queues?</h4> <ul><li>enqueue() adds an element to the end of the queue</li> <li>dequeue() removes an element from the front of the queue</li> <li>init() is used for initializing the queue</li> <li>isEmpty() tests for whether or not the queue is empty</li> <li>The front is used to get the value of the first data item but does not remove it</li> <li>The rear is used to get the last item from a queue</li></ul> <h4 id="define-the-graph-data-structure"><a href="#define-the-graph-data-structure" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define the Graph Data Structure.</h4> <p>It is a type of non-linear data structure that consists of vertices or nodes connected by edges or arcs to enable storage or retrieval of data.

A tree is referred to as a generic tree if its hierarchy is not constrained. In the General Tree, each node can have an endless number of offspring, and all other trees are subsets of the tree.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>The Binary Tree</strong> <br>
The binary tree is a type of tree in which each parent has at least two offspring. The children are referred to as the left and right youngsters. This tree is more popular than most others. When specific limitations and features are given to a Binary tree, various trees such as AVL tree, BST (Binary Search Tree), RBT tree, and so on are also utilized. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Binary Search Tree</strong> <br>
Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree extension that includes numerous optional constraints. In BST, a node's left child value should be less than or equal to the parent value, while the right child value should always be higher than the parent's value.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>The AVL Tree</strong> <br>
The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions). The term AVL is given in honor of the inventors Adelson-Velshi and Landis. This was the first tree to achieve dynamic equilibrium. Each node in the AVL tree is assigned a balancing factor based on whether the tree is balanced or not. The node kids have a maximum height of one AVL vine. Search, insert, delete operations have O(log n) complexity.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Red and Black Tree</strong> <br>
Red-black trees are another type of auto-balancing tree. The red-black term is derived from the qualities of the red-black tree, which has either red or black painted on each node. It helps to keep the forest in balance. Even though this tree is not perfectly balanced, the searching process takes just O(log n) time. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>The N-ary Tree</strong> <br>
In this sort of tree with a node, N is the maximum number of children. A binary tree is a two-year tree since each binary tree node has no more than two offsprings. A full N-ary tree is one in which the children of each node are either 0 or N. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Octree</strong> <br>

During rotations the fundamental property of binary trees must be satisfied that the right child node is bigger than the parent and the left one is smaller. After rotations balance factors are calculated again and if they are -1,0 or 1 a new element can be inserted. Otherwise rotations are conducted further until balanced state is achieved.</p> <h4 id="explain-the-mechanism-of-self-balancing-in-red-black-trees"><a href="#explain-the-mechanism-of-self-balancing-in-red-black-trees" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain the mechanism of Self-Balancing in Red-Black Trees.</h4> <p>The fundamental rules of Red-Black Trees are:<br>
1. Every node has a color either red or black.<br>
2. The root of the tree is always black.<br>
3. There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).<br>
4. Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendants NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.<br>
5. Every leaf (e.i. NULL node) must be colored BLACK.<br>
After insertion two basic operations are used in order to ensure the balance: <strong>Rotation and Recolouring</strong>. First, an element is inserted like in general binary trees and coloured red. One tries first the recolouring during balancing and if it does not work, rotations are conducted. If the new node (<strong>child</strong>) appears to be the root it is recoloured in black (see properties). Check the colour of the parent (<strong>father</strong>) node. If it is black then left the colour of the child node as red. If the father is also red, check the colour of its opposite node (<strong>uncle</strong>) on the same level. If the color of this node is also red then change both father and uncle nodes to black and the <strong>grandfather</strong> (parent node of father and uncle) to red if its not the root node, otherwise do not change the grandfathers color. Repeat the procedure for grandfather upwards. But if the uncle's color is black then rotations in 4 possible ways are conducted untill one can recolour the new arrangement of the nodes.</p> <h4 id="what-is-recursion"><a href="#what-is-recursion" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Recursion?</h4> <p>Recursion is defined as a process which calls itself directly or indirectly and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

Using linear programming provides us with the best possible outcome in a given situation. It uses all the available resources in a manner such that they produce the optimum result. Problems like Transportation, manufacturing and diet can be solved by this approach. <br>
A linear programming problem consits of <strong>Decision Variables</strong>, <strong>Objective Function</strong>, <strong>Constraints</strong> and <strong>Non-negative Restrictions</strong>.
Decision variables are the variables x, and y, which decide the output of the linear programming problem and represent the final solution.
The objective function, generally represented by Z, is the linear function that needs to be optimized according to the given condition to get the final solution. The restrictions imposed on decision variables that limit their values are called constraints.
Now, the general formula of a linear programming problem is:<br>
Objective Function: Z = ax + by <br>
Constraints: cx + dy ≥ e, px + qy ≤ r <br>
Non-Negative restrictions: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 <br>
The methods of solving linear programming problems are <strong>Simplex</strong> and <strong>Graphical</strong>.</p> <p>Steps for the <strong>Simplex Method</strong> are:</p> <p>Step 1: Formulate the linear programming problems based on the given constraints.</p> <p>Step 2: Convert all the given inequalities to equations or equalities of the linear programming problems by adding the slack variable to each inequality where ever required.</p> <p>Step 3: Construct the initial simplex table. By representing each constraint equation in a row and writing the objective function at the bottom row. The table so obtained is called the Simplex table.</p> <p>Step 4: Identify the greatest negative entry in the bottom row the column of the element with the highest negative entry is called the pivot column</p> <p>Step 5: Divide the entries of the right-most column with the entries of the respective pivot column, excluding the entries of the bottommost row. Now the row containing the least entry is called the pivot row. The pivot element is obtained by the intersection of the pivot row and the pivot column.</p> <p>Step 6: Using matrix operation and with the help of the pivot element make all the entries in the pivot column to be zero.</p> <p>Step 7: Check for the non-negative entries in the bottommost row if there are no negative entries in the bottom row, end the process else start the process again from step 4.</p> <p>Step 8: The final simplex table so obtained gives the solution to our problem.</p> <p>Steps for the <strong>Graphical Method</strong> are:</p> <p>Step 1: First convert the inequations into normal equations.</p> <p>Step 2: Find the points at which equations cut the x-axis and y-axis. To find the point of intersection of the x-axis put y = 0 in the respective equation and find the point. Similarly for y-axis intersection points put x = 0 in the respective equation.</p> <p>Step 3: Draw the lines cutting the x-axis and y-axis.</p> <p>Step 4: The region will include an area region enclosed by two axes and all lines including the origin.</p> <p>Step 5: Find Z for each intersection point and thus maxima and minima.</p> <h4 id="what-is-backtracking"><a href="#what-is-backtracking" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Backtracking?</h4> <p>Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end.

Some of the popular DBMS’s are MySql, Oracle, PostgreSql, SqLite, etc.</p> <h4 id="define-rdbms"><a href="#define-rdbms" class="header-anchor">#</a> Define RDBMS.</h4> <p>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is based on a relational model of data that is stored in databases in separate tables and they are related to the use of a common column. Data can be accessed easily from the relational database using Structured Query Language (SQL).</p> <h4 id="enlist-the-advantages-of-dbms"><a href="#enlist-the-advantages-of-dbms" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist the advantages of DBMS.</h4> <p>The advantages of DBMS includes:</p> <ul><li>Data is stored in a structured way and hence redundancy is controlled.</li> <li>Validates the data entered and provide restrictions on unauthorized access to the database.</li> <li>Provides backup and recovery of the data when required.</li> <li>It provides multiple user interfaces.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-do-you-understand-by-data-redundancy"><a href="#what-do-you-understand-by-data-redundancy" class="header-anchor">#</a> What do you understand by Data Redundancy?</h4> <p>Duplication of data in the database is known as data redundancy. As a result of data redundancy, duplicated data is present at multiple locations, hence it leads to wastage of the storage space and the integrity of the database is destroyed.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-primary-key-in-a-relational-database"><a href="#what-is-a-primary-key-in-a-relational-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Primary Key in a Relational Database?</h4> <p>A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values uniquely identify a row in the table. A relational database is designed to enforce the uniqueness of primary keys by allowing only one row with a given primary key value in a table.</p> <h4 id="what-is-a-foreign-key-in-a-relational-database"><a href="#what-is-a-foreign-key-in-a-relational-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a Foreign Key in a Relational Database?</h4> <p>A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table whose values correspond to the values of the primary key in another table. In order to add a row with a given foreign key value, there must exist a row in the related table with the same primary key value.</p> <h4 id="what-are-non-key-attributes"><a href="#what-are-non-key-attributes" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are Non-key Attributes?</h4> <p>Non-key attributes are attributes that are not part of any key. Generally, most attributes are simply descriptive, and fall into this category. Consider an Employee entity type that has attributes for first name, last name, birth date; these attributes would serve to describe an employee but would not serve to uniquely identify employees.</p> <h4 id="categorize-data-modification-anomalies-in-a-database"><a href="#categorize-data-modification-anomalies-in-a-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> Categorize Data Modification Anomalies in a Database.</h4> <ul><li><strong>Insertion Anomaly</strong>: Insertion Anomaly refers to when one cannot insert a new tuple into a relationship due to lack of data.</li> <li><strong>Deletion Anomaly</strong>: The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.</li> <li><strong>Updatation Anomaly</strong>: The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-are-the-various-types-of-relationships-in-database-define-them"><a href="#what-are-the-various-types-of-relationships-in-database-define-them" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the various types of relationships in Database? Define them.</h4> <p>There are 3 types of relationships in Database:</p> <ul><li><strong>One-to-one</strong>: One table has a relationship with another table having the similar kind of column. Each primary key relates to only one or no  record in the related table.</li> <li><strong>One-to-many</strong>: One table has a relationship with another table that has primary and foreign key relations. The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one or many records in the related table.</li> <li><strong>Many-to-many</strong>: Each record in both the tables can relate to many numbers of records in another table.</li></ul> <h4 id="explain-normalization-and-de-normalization"><a href="#explain-normalization-and-de-normalization" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain Normalization and De-Normalization.</h4> <p><strong>Normalization</strong> is the process of removing redundant data from the database by splitting the table in a well-defined manner in order to maintain data integrity. This process saves much of the storage space. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.</p> <p><strong>De-normalization</strong> is the process of adding up redundant data on the table in order to speed up the complex queries and thus achieve better performance.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-different-types-of-normalization"><a href="#what-are-the-different-types-of-normalization" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the different types of Normalization?</h4> <p>Different types of Normalization are:</p> <ul><li><strong>First Normal Form (1NF)</strong>: A relation is said to be in 1NF only when all the entities of the table contain unique or atomic values. It meens all rows must be unique, each cell must contain only single value (not a list) and each value should be non-divisible (can't be split down further).</li> <li><strong>Second Normal Form (2NF)</strong>: A relation is said to be in 2NF only if it is in 1NF and all the non-key attribute of the table is fully dependent on the primary key. For example we have a table with columns composed of Student ID, Course ID and Course Fee. Course Fee does not depend fully on the primary key represented by Student ID. In order to achieve 2NF on splits the table in one that contains Student ID and Course ID and another that contains Course ID and Course Fee.</li> <li><strong>Third Normal Form (3NF)</strong>: A relation is said to be in 3NF only if it is in 2NF and every non-key attribute of the table is not transitively dependent on the primary key. For example if we have a table containing Tournament Name, Year, Winner's Name and Winner's Date of Birth. Winners date of birth can be defined by winner's name and not by the primary key represented by tournament name and year, so the table must be split.</li></ul> <h4 id="what-is-bcnf"><a href="#what-is-bcnf" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is BCNF?</h4> <p>BCNF is the Boyce Code Normal form. It is the higher version of 3Nf which does not have any multiple overlapping candidate keys. For example if we have a table with Student ID, Corse ID and Professor ID, where the same course could be held by different professors, we have to split the table into table eith Student ID and professor ID and the table with professor ID and Course ID.</p> <h4 id="what-is-sql"><a href="#what-is-sql" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is SQL?</h4> <p>Structured Query language, SQL is an ANSI (American National Standard Institute) standard programming language that is designed specifically for storing and managing the data in the relational database management system (RDBMS) using all kinds of data operations.</p> <h4 id="how-many-sql-statements-are-used-define-them"><a href="#how-many-sql-statements-are-used-define-them" class="header-anchor">#</a> How many SQL statements are used? Define them.</h4> <p>SQL statements are basically divided into three categories, DDL, DML, and DCL. <br>
They can be defined as:</p> <ul><li><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong> commands are used to define the structure that holds the data. These commands are auto-committed i.e. changes done by the DDL commands on the database are saved permanently.</li> <li><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong> commands are used to manipulate the data of the database. These commands are not auto-committed and can be rolled back.</li> <li><strong>Data Control Language (DCL)</strong> commands are used to control the visibility of the data in the database like revoke access permission for using data in the database.</li></ul> <h4 id="enlist-some-commands-of-ddl-dml-and-dcl"><a href="#enlist-some-commands-of-ddl-dml-and-dcl" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enlist some commands of DDL, DML and DCL.</h4> <ul><li><p><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL) commands:</strong> <br>
CREATE to create a new table or database.<br>
ALTER for alteration.<br>
TRUNCATE to delete data from the table.<br>
DROP to drop a table.<br>
RENAME to rename a table.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands:</strong><br>
INSERT to insert a new row.<br>
UPDATE to update an existing row.<br>
