# Feature1.1: As a freelance developer I want the first iteration of my portfolio to have a personal information and a structured view so i can iteratively fill it out

ITE: 8 h
RTR: 16 h
DoD: you can open the url vperepos.github.io and find a site where you see a personal foto, name, title, short description of the subtopics and menu with navigation to subtopics. The site must be adaptive (readable on all computing platforms). It is enough at this increment to have Topics such as Curriculum and  Contact and Availability
