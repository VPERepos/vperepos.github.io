## Possible interview questions.
### Interview questions for algorithms and data structures.
**1. What is a data structure?**<br>
In computer science, a data structure is a **data organization**, and storage format that is usually chosen **for efficient access** to data.<br>

**2. Describe the types of data structures?**<br>
* **Array** - an array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type. Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required.<br>
* **List** - a linked list is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.<br>
* **Record** - a record (also **called tuple** or **struct**) is an **aggregate data structure**. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects. <br>
* **Hash tables** -  also known as hash maps, are data structures that provide fast retrieval of values based on keys. They use a hashing function to map keys to indexes in an array, allowing for constant-time access in the average case. Hash tables are commonly used in dictionaries, caches, and database indexing. However, hash collisions can occur, which can impact their performance. Techniques like chaining and open addressing are employed to handle collisions.<br>
* **Graphs** - collections of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between entities. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have cycles or be acyclic.<br>
* **Stacks and queues** - abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. A stack has two primary operations: push (adds an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removes the topmost element from the stack), that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Queues have two main operations: enqueue (adds an element to the rear of the queue) and dequeue (removes an element from the front of the queue) that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.<br>
* **Trees** - represent a hierarchical organization of elements. A tree consists of nodes connected by edges, with one node being the root and all other nodes forming subtrees. **Binary trees** (particularly heaps), **AVL trees**, and **B-trees** are some popular types of trees. They enable efficient and optimal searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation of data.
* **Trie** - also known as a **prefix tree**, is a specialized tree data structure used for the efficient retrieval of strings. Tries store characters of a string as nodes, with each edge representing a character. They are particularly useful in text processing scenarios like autocomplete, spell-checking, and dictionary implementations. Tries enable fast searching and prefix-based operations on strings.
